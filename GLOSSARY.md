# Free Association Glossary

## Core Concepts

### Association
A set of relations where each relation consists of provider and user roles, which become active only when both role-holders express desire and active participation. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties. *Related to: Role, Mutual-Desire, Mutual-Playing*

### Free Association
A system that allows for the spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other without centralized control, planning, private property or state intervention. Requires mutual recognition, mutual desire, mutual playing, and access to social-material coordination. *Related to: Self-Actualization, Mutual Recognition, Mutual-Desire, Mutual-Playing*

### Mutual Recognition
The minimum of two individuals' recognition of each other (minimum of A's recognition of B and B's recognition of A). This ensures reciprocity in proportion and represents mutual contributions toward each other's self-actualization. *Related to: Recognition, Total Recognition, Surplus Distribution*

### Mutual-Desire
When both parties in a relation genuinely desire the relation (Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A)). This is a prerequisite for a relation becoming active in Free Association. *Related to: Mutual-Playing, Association*

### Mutual-Fulfillment
When two people recognize and contribute to each other's self-actualization, creating a reciprocal relationship where both parties' needs, values, and goals are supported. This forms the basis for surplus distribution. *Related to: Self-Actualization, Mutual Recognition, Surplus Distribution*

### Mutual-Playing
When both parties in a relation not only desire it but actively participate in it (Mutual-Desire(A↔B) ∧ Playing(A→B) ∧ Playing(B→A)). This active participation brings the relation into existence. *Related to: Mutual-Desire, Association*

### Property Relations
The legal framework enforcing exclusive control over means of contribution, maintained by state power and increasingly contradicted by the practical utilization of resources in Free Association. *Related to: State Power, Means of Contribution*

### Recognition
One's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies, etc.). In Free Association, recognition is always a portion of one's total recognition. *Related to: Total Recognition, Mutual Recognition, True Recognition, False Recognition*

### Role
A position within a relation that has a holder who can express desire (will to play) and express playing (active participation). Holders can stop expressing desire and playing at any time. In Free Association, roles can be surplus and distributed to others. *Related to: Association, Provider Role, User Role, Surplus*

### Self-Actualization
The realization of one's full potential through the fulfillment of needs, values, goals, and dependencies. In Free Association, self-actualization is achieved through mutual support from others. *Related to: Mutual-Fulfillment, Transitive Self-Actualization*

### Surplus
Roles one holds but does not desire, or more broadly, resources/capacity one has but does not need for oneself. Surplus flows through the network to where it is needed according to mutual recognition distributions. *Related to: Surplus Distribution, Mutual-Fulfillment*

### Surplus Distribution
The process by which surplus is allocated according to mutual recognition values. A person's share of another's surplus equals their mutual recognition divided by the sum of all mutual recognition values between the surplus-holder and everyone they recognize. *Related to: Mutual Recognition, Total-Mutual-Recognition, Surplus*

### Total Recognition
Always equals 100% - the total acknowledgment one has to distribute among all contributors to one's self-actualization. This constraint creates the mathematical property whereby increasing false recognition necessarily decreases true recognition. *Related to: Recognition, True Recognition, False Recognition*

### Transitive Self-Actualization
The ripple effect of contributions spreading beyond direct relationships. When A helps B who then helps C, A indirectly contributes to C's self-actualization, creating an expanding web of mutual fulfillment. *Related to: Self-Actualization, Transitive Relation, Network Growth*

## Mathematical Formulations

### Direct Relation
A connection between two individuals (A ↔ B) where they directly contribute to each other. The foundation of Free Association networks. *Related to: Transitive Relation, Mutual Recognition*

### Mutual-Recognition Formula
MR(A, B) = minimum(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition, A-share-of-B's-total-recognition). This formula ensures reciprocity in proportion. *Related to: Recognition, Total Recognition, Surplus Distribution Formula*

### Surplus Distribution Formula
Share(Receiver ← Giver) = MR(Receiver, Giver) / Sum(MR(Giver, Other) for all Others Giver Recognizes). This formula determines how surplus flows through the network. *Related to: Mutual Recognition, Total-Mutual-Recognition, Surplus*

### Total-Mutual-Recognition
The sum of all mutual recognition values between an individual and everyone they recognize. This forms the denominator in the surplus distribution formula. *Related to: Mutual Recognition, Surplus Distribution Formula*

### Transitive Relation
A connection between individuals that flows through intermediaries (A ↔ B ↔ C), where A and C are transitively connected via B. Enables the network effects of Free Association. *Related to: Direct Relation, Transitive Self-Actualization, Six Degrees of Separation*

## Philosophical Concepts

### Alienation
The separation of workers from the products of their labor, their productive activity, their human nature, and from other humans. Free Association aims to overcome alienation by re-establishing direct social connections between contributors and beneficiaries. *Related to: Commodity Fetish, Subject-Verb-Object Relation*

### Commodity Fetish
The masking of social-material relations of contribution behind the veil of the product as commodity (market-relations) - the objective social-forgetting of the social-origin of things. Free Association overcomes this by focusing on the subject-verb-object relation. *Related to: Subject-Verb-Object Relation, Alienation*

### False Recognition
Recognition given to those who have not actually contributed to one's self-actualization, or recognition inflated beyond the actual contribution made. The mathematics of Free Association ensures that false recognition naturally decays. *Related to: True Recognition, Total Recognition, Social-Material Truth*

### Real Contributors
Those who actually perform the operations necessary to transform social-material reality in concrete-particular ways. In Free Association, real contributors gain recognition based on their actual contributions. *Related to: True Recognition, Social-Material Coordination*

### Reification
The process by which social relations appear as characteristics of things, making human relations seem like relations between objects. Free Association counters this by focusing on direct recognition of human contributions. *Related to: Commodity Fetish, Alienation*

### Social-Material Coordination
The ability to organize and direct material resources and social relationships to achieve fulfillment of needs and desires. Access to this coordination is necessary for Free Association. *Related to: Self-Actualization, Means of Contribution*

### Social-Material Truth
The accurate recognition of who genuinely contributes to one's self-actualization, leading to stronger connections with real contributors and weakening of false relations. Free Association mathematically tends toward this truth. *Related to: True Recognition, False Recognition*

### Subject-Verb-Object Relation
In Free Association, one does not value objects themselves (e.g., apples) but a contributor's provision of those objects (subject-verb-object). This contrasts with commodity production, which values objects divorced from their production process. *Related to: Commodity Fetish, Alienation*

### Six Degrees of Separation
The sociological concept that everyone on Earth is connected to everyone else through at most six degrees of separation. In Free Association, this enables access to surplus from the entire human network through chains of mutual recognition. *Related to: Transitive Relation, Network Growth*

### True Recognition
Accurate acknowledgment of those who have genuinely contributed to one's self-actualization. In Free Association, true recognition strengthens as relationships build on actual contributions. *Related to: False Recognition, Total Recognition, Social-Material Truth*

## Economic Concepts

### Capital Relations
Economic relationships based on the purchase of labor power with capital and the expropriation of surplus value. These become increasingly unstable as Free Association expands. *Related to: Capitalist-Simulated-Production, Second-Order-False-Recognition*

### Capitalist-Simulated-Production
Production appearing to come from capitalist but actually produced by contributors, masking the real social relations of production. Free Association reveals these actual contribution relationships. *Related to: Capital Relations, Commodity Fetish*

### Dual Power
The existence of competing sources of authority - typically the established state apparatus versus emerging forms of self-organization. A transitional state before Free Association fully replaces state functions. *Related to: State Power*

### Means of Contribution
The resources, tools, knowledge, and infrastructure necessary for productive activity and contribution to others' self-actualization. In Free Association, these are utilized in common rather than privately owned. *Related to: Social-Material Coordination, Property Relations*

### Mutual Aid
A voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. Free Association incorporates and expands this concept through the mathematical foundation of mutual recognition. *Related to: Mutual-Fulfillment, Surplus Distribution*

### Mutual Stakeholding
An economic model where organizations swap ownership shares, creating bidirectional dividend flows. While similar to Free Association in creating non-zero-sum relationships, it differs crucially in that it maintains ownership of others. *Related to: Equity*

### Network Growth
The exponential increase in available surplus and diversity of contributions as Free Association expands through transitive connections, enhancing resilience and reducing the impact of false recognition. *Related to: Six Degrees of Separation, Transitive Self-Actualization*

### Recognition as Bandwidth
A concept being explored where one's receptivity (attention, communication bandwidth) is distributed according to mutual recognition values, allowing each person to control their attention while ensuring it flows proportionally to genuine contributors. *Related to: Recognition, Receptivity-Limit*

### Second-Order-False-Recognition
False recognition given specifically to obtain capital for buying labor-power, a form of distorting true recognition relationships for capital accumulation. *Related to: False Recognition, Capital Relations*

### State-Mediated Governance
Coordination via state apparatus rather than direct free association. Becomes increasingly superfluous as Free Association expands. *Related to: State Power, Social-Material Coordination*

### State-Power
The organized force appearing separate from and above contributors. In Free Association, state power isn't abolished but withers away as its functions become unnecessary. *Related to: State-Mediated Governance*

### State-Simulated-Coordination
Coordination appearing to come from state but actually from contributor self-organization. Free Association reveals the real capacity for self-coordination. *Related to: Social-Material Coordination*

### Equity
A system where individuals own shares of organizations that persist regardless of ongoing contributions. Unlike Free Association, equity allows the past to dominate the present, as shares cannot be readjusted based on new information. *Related to: Mutual Stakeholding*

## Practical Implementations

### Provider Role
One of the two roles in a relation; the party that provides some resource, service, or contribution to the other. *Related to: Role, User Role*

### User Role
One of the two roles in a relation; the party that receives or uses the contribution from the provider. *Related to: Role, Provider Role*

### Receptivity-Limit
A proposed concept where individuals can set limits on how much input they receive from others (such as messages or requests), with each person's share of this limit determined by their share of the individual's total recognition. *Related to: Recognition as Bandwidth, Total Recognition*

### Proportion-Setting-Power
A concept for collective decision-making where each member has equal power to set proportions for how resources should be allocated across different areas of community self-actualization. *Related to: Self-Actualization, Mutual-Fulfillment*
