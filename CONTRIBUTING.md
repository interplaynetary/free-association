# Contributing to Free-Association

Welcome to the Free-Association project! We're building an alternative to capitalism based on mutual recognition and surplus distribution. Your contributions help create a system where the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

## Core Development Values

### Permissionless Innovation

- **Experiment freely** - You don't need permission to try new approaches
- **Fail fast** - Surface errors early and visibly to learn quickly
- **Share experiments** - Document what you try, whether it works or not
- **Build on others' work** - Extend and improve existing contributions

### Stigmergic Coordination

- **Indirect collaboration** - Contribute to shared environments that others can build upon
- **Leave traces** - Document your work so others can understand and extend it
- **Follow the work** - Look for active areas where your skills can add value
- **Amplify good patterns** - Recognize and extend solutions that work well

### Granularity & Transaction Cost Reduction

- **Small, composable contributions** - Break work into manageable units
- **Minimize barriers** - Make it easy for others to participate
- **Clear interfaces** - Provide simple ways to connect different components
- **Reduce friction** - Streamline processes for contribution and feedback

## How to Contribute

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** or **clone directly** if you have access
2. **Set up your development environment**:

   ```bash
   # Install bun if you haven't already
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

   # Install dependencies
   bun install

   # Start development server
   bun run dev

   ```

3. **Find your entry point** - Look for:
   - Issues labeled `good-first-issue`
   - TODOs in the codebase
   - Documentation gaps
   - User interface improvements
   - Testing needs

### üí° Types of Contributions

#### Code Contributions

- **User interface development** - We especially need help with UI/UX
- **Backend functionality** - Implementing core free-association logic
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests
- **Performance optimization** - Making the system more efficient
- **Bug fixes** - Resolving issues and edge cases

#### Non-Code Contributions

- **Documentation** - Explaining concepts, creating tutorials, API docs
- **Translation** - Making the project accessible in multiple languages
- **Design** - User experience, visual design, accessibility improvements
- **Research** - Exploring mathematical properties, economic implications
- **Community building** - Organizing events, creating content, outreach

#### Resource Contributions

- **Housing/workspace** - Supporting core contributors with space
- **Financial support** - Through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/playnet)
- **Skills sharing** - Teaching others, mentoring newcomers
- **Network connections** - Introducing the project to relevant communities

### üîß Development Process

#### Design Principles

- **Modularity** - Create components that can be combined in various ways
- **Interoperability** - Ensure different systems can connect seamlessly
- **Composability** - Allow components to be recombined in new configurations
- **Simplicity** - Favor simple solutions over complex ones
- **Fit-for-purpose** - Design for actual use cases rather than theoretical perfection

#### Code Standards

- **Selection pressure** - Expose code to real-world conditions early
- **Antifragility** - Write code that gains from disorder and adapts to change
- **Graceful degradation** - Maintain basic functionality when components fail
- **Statelessness** - Design components without internal state when possible
- **Separation of concerns** - Divide responsibilities into distinct sections

#### Testing Philosophy

- **Chaos engineering** - Deliberately introduce failures to build resilience
- **Integration testing** - Test how components work together
- **User acceptance testing** - Validate that features serve real needs
- **Negative testing** - Document what doesn't work to prevent future mistakes

### üåä Contribution Workflow

1. **Identify need** - Find something that contributes to your own or others' self-actualization
2. **Start small** - Begin with manageable changes that can be quickly validated
3. **Document intent** - Explain what you're trying to achieve and why
4. **Implement incrementally** - Make changes in small, reviewable steps
5. **Share early** - Get feedback before investing too much time
6. **Iterate based on feedback** - Use community input to improve your contribution
7. **Celebrate completion** - Acknowledge when contributions are integrated

### ü§ù Community Interaction

#### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues** - For bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions
- **Pull Requests** - For code reviews and collaborative development
- **Telegram** - Join our community at [t.me/+jS7u3ZcKLoxmYWU5](https://t.me/+jS7u3ZcKLoxmYWU5)
- **Email** - For private discussions or sensitive topics

#### Collaboration Principles

- **Assume positive intent** - Approach others with curiosity rather than judgment
- **Share credit generously** - Acknowledge others' contributions to your work
- **Ask questions** - It's better to clarify than to make assumptions
- **Provide context** - Help others understand the background of your contributions
- **Be responsive** - Engage with feedback and questions about your work

### üìã Specific Contribution Areas

#### Current Priority Needs

- **User Interface Development** - Making the system accessible and intuitive
- **Mathematical Verification** - Ensuring the free-association algorithms work correctly
- **Documentation** - Explaining concepts to new users and developers
- **Community Building** - Growing the network of contributors and users
- **Resource Provision** - Housing, food, and financial support for core contributors

#### Getting Started in Each Area

- **UI/UX**: Look at the existing interface, identify pain points, propose improvements
- **Backend**: Examine the mathematical models, implement missing functionality
- **Documentation**: Find concepts that need explanation, create tutorials or examples
- **Community**: Share the project with relevant networks, organize meetups or discussions
- **Resources**: Connect with core contributors about their needs and how you can help

### üåç Vision and Impact

Your contributions to Free-Association help create:

- **Alternative economic systems** that prioritize mutual aid over profit
- **Decentralized networks** where power is distributed rather than concentrated
- **Recognition systems** that acknowledge real contributions to each other's flourishing
- **Surplus distribution** that flows to those who contribute to our shared values
- **Community resilience** that strengthens our collective capacity for self-determination

### üìö Learning Resources

- **Project README** - Overview of free-association concepts and mathematics
- **Values Documentation** - Our core principles and design philosophy
- **Glossary** - Definitions of key terms and concepts
- **Interface Demo** - [interplaynetary.github.io/free-association](https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association/)
- **Community Discussions** - Ongoing conversations about development and implementation

### üéØ Recognition and Gratitude

We recognize that every contribution, no matter how small, helps build a system where we can all flourish. Your participation in this project is itself a form of mutual recognition - you're contributing to something that serves not just individual needs, but collective liberation.

Contributors are acknowledged in:

- **Project documentation** - Listed in README and contributor files
- **Community recognition** - Highlighted in project updates and communications
- **Network effects** - Your contributions become part of the surplus that flows to others
- **Collective ownership** - You become part of a community that owns its own development
