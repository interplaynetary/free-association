# Holster Relay Server

Standalone Holster relay server for the free-association project.

## Configuration

Configure via environment variables:

- `HOLSTER_RELAY_HOST` - Host to bind to (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `HOLSTER_RELAY_PORT` - Port to listen on (default: `8766`)
- `HOLSTER_RELAY_STORAGE` - Enable persistent storage (default: `true`)
- `HOLSTER_RELAY_STORAGE_PATH` - Path for data storage (default: `./holster-data`)
- `HOLSTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` - Maximum concurrent WS connections (default: `100`)

## How it Works

This relay uses Holster's built-in WebSocket server and connection management. All configuration (port, storage, connection limits) is passed directly to Holster in `server.js`, which handles all WebSocket protocol, connection, persistence and relay logic.

Manual WebSocket server setup, connection limiting, and event tracking are no longer necessaryâ€”Holster manages all relay responsibilities internally.

Express is used only for a `/health` endpoint (for Docker/monitoring). All real client connections and relay logic are handled by Holster on `ws://<host>:<port>/holster`.

## Running Locally

```bash
bun install
bun run server.js
```

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker build -t holster-relay .
docker run -p 8766:8766 -v $(pwd)/holster-data:/app/holster-data holster-relay
```

> The Dockerfile now uses the Bun runtime (oven/bun:latest).

## Holster Endpoint

The Holster WebSocket server is accessible at: `ws://localhost:8766/holster`

Health check endpoint: `http://localhost:8766/health`
