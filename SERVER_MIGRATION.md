# Server Migration Complete

The microservices from the `server/` folder have been successfully migrated into SvelteKit server routes.

## What Was Migrated

### Services Converted to SvelteKit Routes:

1. **AI Proxy** (`server/ai-proxy/`) → `src/routes/api/ai/`
   - Main AI completion endpoint with authentication and rate limiting
   - Routes:
     - `GET /api/ai` - API documentation
     - `GET /api/ai/health` - Health check
     - `POST /api/ai/token` - Generate JWT tokens
     - `POST /api/ai/completion` - AI completions (main endpoint)

2. **LLM Router** (`server/llm-router/`) → `src/routes/api/llm/`
   - Intelligent routing based on request types and flows
   - Routes:
     - `GET /api/llm/health` - Health check
     - `GET /api/llm/flows` - List available flows
     - `POST /api/llm/route` - Get routing decision

3. **Key Pool** (`server/key-pool/`) → `src/routes/api/keys/`
   - OpenRouter API key management with health tracking
   - Routes:
     - `GET /api/keys/health` - Service health
     - `GET /api/keys/status` - Pool status
     - `GET /api/keys/:model` - Get a healthy key
     - `POST /api/keys/:model` - Add a key
     - `DELETE /api/keys/:model` - Remove a key
     - `POST /api/keys/health/:model` - Report key health

### Supporting Libraries Created:

- `src/lib/server/schemas/` - Zod validation schemas
  - `completion.ts` - Request/response schemas
  - `routing.ts` - Router and key pool schemas
  - `index.ts` - Exports

- `src/lib/server/llm/` - LLM routing logic
  - `flows.ts` - Flow definitions for different request types
  - `router.ts` - Routing logic

- `src/lib/server/key-pool/` - Key management
  - `manager.ts` - Key pool manager with health tracking

- `src/lib/server/middleware/` - Middleware functions
  - `auth.ts` - Authentication (API key and JWT)
  - `rate-limit.ts` - Rate limiting

## Services NOT Migrated

The following services are database relays and should continue running separately (or be replaced):

- **Gun Relay** (`server/gun-relay/`) - Gun database protocol relay
- **Holster Relay** (`server/holster-relay/`) - Holster database protocol relay

These are infrastructure services that provide database functionality and are not typical HTTP APIs. You can:
1. Keep running them via Docker if needed
2. Replace them with hosted alternatives
3. Embed them in SvelteKit if absolutely necessary (not recommended)

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-me
JWT_EXPIRY=24h
MASTER_API_KEY=your-master-api-key-change-me

# OpenRouter Configuration
OPENROUTER_KEYS=sk-or-v1-your-key-1,sk-or-v1-your-key-2
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

# Application Configuration
APP_URL=https://free-association.playnet.lol
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

All API routes are now available at:
- `http://localhost:5173/api/ai/*`
- `http://localhost:5173/api/llm/*`
- `http://localhost:5173/api/keys/*`

### Testing the APIs

1. **Get a token:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/ai/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"apiKey": "your-master-api-key", "userId": "test-user"}'
```

2. **Make an AI completion request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/ai/completion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "maxTokens": 100
  }'
```

3. **Check key pool status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5173/api/keys/status
```

## Key Features Preserved

✅ **Authentication**: API key and JWT-based authentication  
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Per-user/IP rate limits for API and AI endpoints  
✅ **Token-based Rate Limiting**: Limit AI requests by token usage  
✅ **Flow-based Routing**: Intelligent model selection based on request type  
✅ **Key Pool Management**: Automatic key rotation and health tracking  
✅ **Health Checks**: All services have health endpoints  
✅ **Zod Validation**: Type-safe request validation  

## Differences from Docker Setup

1. **No Docker Required**: Everything runs in the SvelteKit dev server
2. **Simpler Deployment**: Single application to deploy
3. **Better Integration**: Direct access to SvelteKit features
4. **Shared Dependencies**: No need for multiple node_modules
5. **Unified Logs**: All logs in one place

## Migration Notes

- All Express middleware has been adapted to SvelteKit request handlers
- Rate limiting uses in-memory storage (consider Redis for production)
- Key pool is initialized on server start
- Health monitoring runs automatically
- CORS is handled by SvelteKit's built-in mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Set up environment variables in `.env`
2. ✅ Test all endpoints
3. ⏹️ Consider Gun/Holster relay options
4. ⏹️ Update any client code to use new API URLs
5. ⏹️ Deploy to production

## Cleanup

The `server/` folder can now be archived or removed once you've confirmed everything works:

```bash
# Archive for reference
mv server server.archived

# Or remove entirely
rm -rf server
```
