# Free Association Tour Guide

A clean, intuitive tour that introduces Free Association through simple concepts and human language.

## Tour Overview

The tour explains Free Association in the most natural way possible - through human concepts of recognition, contribution, and sharing. No math, no percentages, just the beautiful simplicity of mutual recognition.

## Simplified Tour Flow

1. **Welcome** - A way to recognize contributions and create abundance
2. **Recognition Tree** - You start at yourself, the root of your recognition
3. **Recognition Works Like This** - You have recognition to give to contributors
4. **Add Contributors** - Add people who contribute to your wellbeing
5. **Your Canvas** - Build your recognition tree, set what each deserves
6. **Mutual Recognition** - When you recognize someone AND they recognize you
7. **The Balance** - Both sides matter for mutual recognition
8. **Your Recognition** - How you split recognition among contributors
9. **Mutual Recognition** - Determines your share of their surplus
10. **How Sharing Works** - Stronger mutual recognition = larger share
11. **Why Honesty Works** - False recognition misses real connections
12. **Navigate & Search** - Find anyone in your growing tree
13. **Ready to Begin** - Start with someone who truly contributes

## Philosophy

This tour embodies the truth that the most powerful ideas are often the simplest. Free Association works because it mirrors how humans naturally think about recognition and contribution.

By removing mathematical abstraction, users can feel the elegance of mutual recognition. They understand intuitively why honest recognition creates abundance - not because equations tell them so, but because it resonates with their human experience.

The tour's simplicity reveals the profound truth: Free Association works because it's how humans naturally want to relate to each other.
