RISING INEQUALITY
Something that has become clear to us in the course of our experimentation is that:
1. Money is a transferable form of social recognition and recognition-power.
It is a means of socially-validating and recognizing contributions.
It is the right to express social-value (through the medium of exchange: of course what can be valued in this frame is limited by what can be bought as commodity. Gifting money is the exception)
2. The transferability of recognition-power is what enables its accumulation. 

Which means that:
1. Recognition-power becomes concentrated in fewer hands over time
2. Those with concentrated recognition-power get to decide what has value
3. They naturally value things that protect their accumulated recognition (military, police, legal systems protecting property rights)
4. This reinforces the entire system that enabled their accumulation in the first place

As well as that when you work:
1. You receive a token of social recognition (money)
2. You must surrender this token to survive (buy food)
3. The shop owner accumulates your recognition
4. They can use this accumulated recognition to purchase your labor power

And the cycle repeats, resulting in ever larger inequality, and ever grosser disproportion between real contribution and recognition-power accumulation as ever larger masses of people find themselves with an ever smaller capacity to express their values, to organize social-production around the realization of what they value, and to validate the contribution of others.

Free-Association offers a radical alternative by breaking this cycle through non-transferable recognition. When recognition can't be transferred or accumulated:
1. Each person retains 100% of their recognition power
2. No one can monopolize the power to determine what has value
3. Value can extend beyond commodities to anything that contributes to self-actualization
4. Power hierarchies based on accumulated recognition become impossible

In Free Association, validation of contributions happens through mutual recognition networks rather than through surrendering tokens of value. The recognition I give you for contributing to my self-actualization remains mine to give or redistribute, while simultaneously allowing you access to my surplus based on our mutual recognition.

This changes what society collectively values:
1. In market systems: Value flows primarily to what wealthy people want (luxury goods, military protection of assets, financial instruments)
2. In Free-Association: Value flows to whatever contributes to mutual self-actualization across the network (housing, food, education, community, environmental protection)

We believe this would transform our relationship with crucial issues like climate change, homelessness and inequality. Rather than being limited to expressing concern through purchasing air conditioners or carbon offsets (commodities), we could directly recognize and allocate surplus toward solving climate change itself or restoring ecological systems. The value isn't limited to what can be bought and sold.
