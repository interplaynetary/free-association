The bidirectional linking between types and instances creates exactly the kind of "provider/user" relationship described in the README, where roles are filled through mutual desire rather than obligation. Notice how addType calls addInstance and vice versa, establishing a mutual relationship - this implements the philosophical principle that "relations in free-association activate only through mutual desire and participation."


So perhaps a function type.shift() that distributes types based on surplus!
So types get dynamically reassigned!
