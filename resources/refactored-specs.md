### Node
- Name
- Self:
    Declare your availbility slots
- Network:
    Shares from others at this branch of tree (if they exist)
    (Shares in (of this path-name), see all space-time-specific availability slots with this path name: Expand them and see specific space-time-slots)
    Click a space-time-slot: open the chat, get directions
    (Slots would ordered by MR or quantity or space-time-availabilty)

## Network-Nodes SidePanel
shows other possible branches from my network at this level in the tree
(Using Dragged Node)

## Availability-slots
- Input: Desire (quantity) [from you]
- Input: Fulfillment (0-100%)
- Offered (quantity) [to you]
- Total-Quantity [from offerer]
- Network-Desire (quantity) [in total]
- Distribution Filters

## Slot-distribution Algorithm
Offered according to mutual-fulfillment
When desire is less than recieved, can tell others to reallocate 

### Contribution-Recognition Nodee
- For a given space-time-slot

## Mutual-Fulfillment Algorithm
- ShareOfNodeFulfillment
- For a given Capacity-category/Share (Do we value all space-time-slots the same along the dimension of quantity)
- Or value certain space-time-slots more than others (irrespective quantity)
- i.e. i value 10 apples now over 100 apples next year

Contributor share of my total-recognition

Some contributions cant be quantified into slots!

## Unified Tree


### Questions:
- Does valuaing at the contributor level make sense if we already have peoples claims as to their support
