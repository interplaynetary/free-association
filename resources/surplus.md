Dear Friends,

If you are receiving this message, it is because someone or something recognized that you might be interested in a different way of organizing human relationships - one based not on ownership, debt, or forced cooperation, but on genuine mutual recognition and support.

This is not just another economic proposal. It is a mathematical framework for how humans can freely contribute to each other's self-actualization, where surplus flows naturally to where it's needed, and where relationships form through authentic recognition rather than obligation.

What follows is both a technical specification and a vision of possibility. We invite you to read with both your analytical mind and your intuitive sense of what human relationships could be.

With love and esteem,
- Ruzgar Imski

## Free-Association: A Call for Mutual Self-Actualization

We present a formulation of a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the *spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other* without any centralized control, planning, private-property or state intervention!

This requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (tangible and intangible contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.).

**In this free association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of mutual-contribution!**

**Mathematically defined:**
```
One's Recognition = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization
One's Total-Recognition = 100%
Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)

Your share of anyone's surplus = MR(You, Them) / Σ MR(Them, Each-of-Those-They-Recognize)
```

**For example:** If you are 50% of my total-recognition, and I am 10% of your total-recognition, our mutual-recognition is 10%, the minimum of the both.

*Taking the minimum of both shares ensures reciprocity in proportion.*

Surplus flows through mutual-recognition of mutual-contribution.

This is not a zero-sum game where one person's gain is another's loss. Instead of climbing individual ladders in competition, we are collectively building something greater - like a vast treehouse where each new branch and platform strengthens the entire structure. Every contribution enriches the whole network while benefiting the contributor through strengthened relationships and increased access to mutual support.

## How Your Contributions Flow Through the Network

When you contribute surplus to Free Association:

1. **Your surplus flows to direct contributors** - Those you recognize as contributing to your self-actualization receive proportional access to your surplus

2. **Your surplus flows to transitive contributors** - Those who support your direct contributors also benefit, creating ripple effects through the network

3. **The network self-corrects toward social-material-truth** - Mathematical properties ensure that false recognition naturally diminishes while true recognition strengthens:

```
For any participant:
Total Recognition = 100%
Total Recognition = True-Recognition + False-Recognition
   ∴ ↑False-Recognition = ↓True-Recognition
      ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Real-Contributors
         ∴ ↓Real-Surplus from Real-Contributors
            ∴ ↓Real-Relations with Real-Contributors
               ∴ ↓Access to Real-Social-Material-Coordination
                  ∴ ↓Real-Social-Material-Basis for Self-Actualization

```

This mathematical property ensures that inflating recognition or maintaining false-recognition only decreases your connection to real-contributors.

Systems built on falsehood eventually collapse, they can't sustain themselves because they starve the very thing that makes them thrive, genuine connection and collaboration.

4. **Effects return to you in unexpected ways** - As others you've supported gain capacity, they can contribute to your self-actualization in ways you couldn't predict.

To illustrate this by example: Imagine a potluck where pies you bake that you don't need (surplus) helps a neighbor spend less time cooking, *freeing their time* to fix their oven — the same oven that later bakes bread for your community garden party. That's mutual-fulfillment: Your surplus doesn't vanish—it flows to those who directly/indirectly align with your needs/desires/values/goals, creating a ripple effect of mutual-support that comes back to you in unexpected ways while strengthening the network.

## The Power of Six Degrees: Accessing Humanity's Cooperative Wealth

In free association, surplus doesn't just flow to direct connections — it flows through networks of mutual recognition that ultimately connect all of humanity.

Consider this mathematical reality:
```
For any participants A, B, C:
- Direct Relation: A ↔ B (A and B directly connected)
- Transitive Relation: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and C transitively connected via B)
- Your share of anyone's surplus = MR(You, Them) / Σ MR(Them, Each-of-Those-They-Recognize)
```

Now combine this with a profound sociological discovery: everyone on Earth is connected to everyone else through at most six degrees of separation. In free association, this means:

1. **First Degree**: Your direct contributors (friends, colleagues, local community)
   - Their surplus flows to you based on your mutual recognition
   - You gain access to their skills, knowledge, resources

2. **Second Degree**: Contributors to your contributors
   - A neighbor's friend who grows food
   - A colleague's network of skilled programmers
   - Each connection multiplies available surplus

3. **Third Degree**: Entire communities and networks
   - Housing cooperatives
   - Knowledge networks
   - Production collectives
   - Each node represents hundreds of potential surplus flows

4. **Fourth through Sixth Degrees**: Global reach
   - Access to surplus from every field of human endeavor
   - Connection to cultural production worldwide
   - Integration with global networks of mutual support
   - Each step exponentially increases available surplus

This means that in free association, you're never more than six distributions away from accessing any surplus role in the entire human network! Unlike markets which restrict access through price mechanisms, or states which centrally plan distribution, free association creates organic flows based on real contributions to each other's self-actualization.

**The Mathematics of Network Growth:**
```
At each degree n:
- Available Surplus = Σ(Contributors' Surplus)
- Your share of anyone's surplus = MR(You, Them) / Σ MR(Them, Each-of-Those-They-Recognize)
- Transitive Share(You, Them) = Direct Share(You, Them) + 
                             Direct Share(You, Node) * ... * Direct Share(Node, Them)
      for all Nodes connecting You to Them at n degrees

- Total Transitive Access = Σ Transitive Share(You, Each) for All
```

This exponential growth means that as free association spreads:
* Your potential access to surplus grows exponentially
* The diversity of available contributions increases dramatically
* The network becomes increasingly resilient
* False recognition becomes increasingly disadvantageous as real alternatives multiply

Imagine:
- A designer in Brazil whose surplus creativity flows through the network to enhance your local project
- An engineer in Kenya whose surplus technical knowledge helps solve challenges in your community
- A housing cooperative in Denmark whose surplus space becomes available through chains of mutual recognition
- A food forest in Thailand whose surplus production strengthens your local food security

All of these connections become possible through no more than six degrees of mutual recognition distributions. This isn't just an abstract possibility — it's mathematical certainty based on network-mathematics (contribution-graphs and contribution-distance) combined with free association's distribution mechanics.

The result? A world where:
* Every individual has potential access to humanity's full cooperative wealth
* Surplus flows efficiently to where it contributes to real self-actualization
* False recognition naturally decays as real alternatives become visible
* The free development of each truly becomes the condition for the free development of all

This is why contributing to free association isn't just about direct relationships—it's about participating in and strengthening a network that can ultimately connect all of humanity through mutual recognition and surplus distribution. Your contributions don't just help immediate recipients; they help build and strengthen pathways through which humanity's cooperative wealth can flow more freely.

Note: this level of access to the wealth of social-abundance can be overwhelming for inviduals! Various organizational elements, games, organizations, structures, algorithms, interface extensions should be explored to help individuals navigate and interact with this abundance of access while minimizing overwhelm. When indivudals form communities that freely associate with eachother, communal organization of surplus can help minimize the burden on individuals to need to process the whole of this abundance. Free association between individuals, between organizations, between individuals and organizations, between organizations and individuals.

## Current Needs for Free Association Development

The free association project currently seeks support in:

* User-interface development
* Housing and food for core contributors
* Skills and time for implementation of remaining functionality
* Financial resources to sustain ongoing development

A basic interface for free association is almost complete but we are seeking support in user-interface-development as well as support in the form of housing, food etc.

## How to Contribute

**Support Financially:** [opencollective.com/playnet](https://opencollective.com/playnet)

**Contribute Skills/Time:** Contact us to discuss how your skills align with current development needs

**Provide Housing/Space:** If you have surplus housing or workspace that could support Free Association contributors

**Spread Awareness:** Share the mathematical proof and potential of Free Association with others who might contribute surplus

Remember: In contributing to Free Association, you're not donating to charity or investing for return. You're participating in a network where **the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all**. Your contributions help build a system where "individuals freely contribute to each other's self-actualization, where surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions towards each other's self-actualization, where relations activate only through mutual desire and participation."

Your surplus becomes part of a living network of mutual-fulfillment that transcends both charity and investment—it becomes a concrete expression of truly free association.


## Appendix

### This Is Not Charity

When you contribute surplus to Free Association, you are not engaging in charity. In charity, resources flow one-way from giver to receiver, creating dependency and hierarchical relations. The giver likely receives nothing material in return, only perhaps some moral satisfaction or tax benefits.

In Free Association, your contributions become integrated into a network of mutual recognition. Your surplus (whether money, housing, skills, or time) helps others who **directly or transitively contribute to your own self-actualization**.

This transcends both traditional charity and market exchange by creating organic flows of surplus based on real contributions to each other's self-actualization. Your surplus becomes part of a living network that strengthens the social fabric while returning to you in unexpected ways.


### This Is Not Investment

In traditional investment and equity structures, you provide capital expecting financial returns and ownership. You acquire equity — a fixed share that persists regardless of your ongoing contributions. The past (your initial investment) dominates the present.

Consider mutual stakeholding with traditional equity: Organizations swap shares, creating bidirectional dividend (surplus) flows. While this creates non-zero-sum economic relationships where each gains by increasing others' well-being, it has a **crucial** flaw: In equity, you *own* a share of others.

This ownership model means:
* You can deploy duplicitous means to gain recognition
* Once you secure shares, you *own* that recognition permanently
* The Past dominates the Present — you cannot remove recognition of past contributions that are no longer true
* The transferability of shares/tokens enables accumulation of false recognition that persists even when new information reveals the truth
* mutual-false-recognition persists indefinitely.

In Free Association:

* You don't "own" a share of anyone else — we each own 100% of ourselves
* Recognition can be re-attributed at any time based on real contributions
* The Present reigns over the Past — recognition adjusts to reflect current social-material reality
* False recognition naturally decays while true recognition strengthens through mathematical necessity:
```
For any participant:
Total Recognition = 100%
Total Recognition = True-Recognition + False-Recognition
   ∴ ↑False-Recognition = ↓True-Recognition
      ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Real-Contributors
         ∴ ↓Real-Surplus from Real-Contributors
            ∴ ↓Real-Relations with Real-Contributors
               ∴ ↓Access to Real-Social-Material-Coordination
                  ∴ ↓Real-Social-Material-Basis for Self-Actualization
```

This mathematical property ensures that inflating recognition or maintaining false-recognition only decreases your connection to real-contributors. You cannot accumulate power through ownership.

In Free Association, we are free! You don't own me, and I don't own you! We owe each other nothing!

This is Hegel's resolution of the master-slave dialectic realized in practice: mutual recognition without ownership or domination. Your contributions don't buy you permanent shares — they participate in an evolving network of mutual-recognition that continuously adjusts to reflect real social-material contributions.
