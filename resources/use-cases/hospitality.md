Here's a user story about mutual hospitality through free association:

Alice has a spare room and various resources in her home that she's willing to share. She creates associations for different aspects of hospitality: space-time resources, basic necessities, digital infrastructure, knowledge resources, social resources, and practical support. For each of these categories, she holds provider roles indicating her capacity and willingness to contribute these resources to others' self-actualization.

Bob, a traveling researcher, discovers Alice's hospitality offerings. He expresses desire for specific resources by toggling desire on user roles that match his needs: a quiet workspace during mornings, kitchen access for breakfast, wifi connectivity for research, and local knowledge about the academic community. This creates a clear signal about which aspects of Alice's offering resonate with his self-actualization needs.

As they begin their hospitality relationship, both Alice and Bob toggle "playing" on their respective roles. Alice actively provides the specific resources Bob desires, while Bob actively uses them in alignment with their mutual understanding. Through daily interactions, they discover additional ways they contribute to each other's growth: Bob shares insights from his research that fascinate Alice, while Alice introduces Bob to her local artist community that enriches his research perspective.

Their mutual recognition of contribution grows beyond the initial hospitality arrangement. Alice recognizes how Bob's academic perspectives and connections contribute to her intellectual growth, while Bob recognizes how Alice's social resources and local knowledge enhance his research. This mutual recognition is reflected in their distribution of surplus: when Alice has extra time, she prioritizes enhancing the resources Bob finds most valuable; when Bob receives research grants, he channels support back to Alice's projects that fostered his work.

The beauty of this free association is its organic evolution based on real contributions to mutual flourishing. What began as a simple hospitality arrangement grows into a rich relationship of reciprocal support, with each person's surplus naturally flowing toward the aspects and people that genuinely contribute to their self-actualization. Their association remains free - not bound by fixed obligations or standardized exchanges - but strengthened by their ongoing mutual recognition of how they enhance each other's lives.

## Ok great story! lets stick with it! Now lets focus on the specifics very concretely what information would be necessary to convey, and how would it be revealed with desires, playing relation-playing in order to facilitate their coordination? For example space-time interaction? At what point would either party input/reveal what information in order to facilitate coordination? Especially among strangers

Let me break down the coordination dance between Alice and Bob, focusing on space-time resources as an example:

Initially, Alice (provider) reveals:
- Available time windows (e.g., "Morning quiet hours 7-11am, Afternoon workspace 1-5pm")
- Space configurations ("Quiet study corner with desk in living room, Kitchen table workspace")
- Basic boundaries ("No guests after 10pm, Shared bathroom schedule")
She does this by creating these specific associations and toggling "desires" on her provider roles, making them visible as available.

Bob (potential user) first reveals:
- Desired time windows ("Need morning workspace 8-11am")
- Space needs ("Quiet desk space for laptop work and video calls")
- Duration ("2 weeks in March")
He expresses this by toggling "desires" on the corresponding user roles that match his needs.

Only after mutual "desires" are established, they reveal more specific coordination details:
- Bob: Specific dates, arrival time, work schedule patterns
- Alice: WiFi details, entry/key arrangements, bathroom schedule
This happens when both parties toggle "playing" on their roles.

Finally, when the relation is "playing" (both actively participating):
- Real-time coordination becomes possible ("I'll need the desk early tomorrow")
- Feedback loops emerge ("Video calls were too loud for living room, let's try balcony")
- Adjustments can be made ("Morning schedule shifted to 7-10am works better")

The key is progressive revelation of information - from general availability → specific needs → detailed coordination → real-time adjustments,

Ok how about another approach: what if a one's share of my GeneralContribution was reflective of their proportion of a total-number-of-bits i am receptive to from them?

Brilliant insight! This creates a direct connection between contribution recognition and communication bandwidth. Let me break this down:

1. **Bits as Contribution Recognition**
- Instead of abstract "contribution," we measure it in concrete communication capacity
- Your willingness to receive X bits from someone directly reflects their contribution to your self-actualization
- The more someone contributes to your flourishing, the more "bandwidth" you allocate to them

2. **Progressive Communication Capacity**
- "Desires" might open a small, fixed number of bits (like a 140-character message)
- "Playing" opens a larger channel (regular messages)
- Your share of someone's GeneralContribution determines your maximum bandwidth
- This creates natural communication priorities based on real contribution

3. **Practical Implementation**
- Each person has a finite total bandwidth (total bits they can receive)
- They distribute this bandwidth among contributors
- Someone with 30% of your GeneralContribution gets 30% of your available bandwidth
- This creates natural scarcity and prioritization in communication

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**
- As contribution recognition changes, bandwidth allocations adjust
- Growing mutual contribution = growing mutual bandwidth
- Reduced contribution = reduced bandwidth
- Creates organic evolution of communication capacity

5. **Concrete Example**
```
Alice's Total Bandwidth: 1000 bits/day
Bob's Contribution Share: 20
