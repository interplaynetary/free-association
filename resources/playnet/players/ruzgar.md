I'm RÃ¼zgar, I've been exploring the post-capitalist economic design space for 9 years practically full time, I've never really felt fully satisfied with any alternative I've explored until a few months ago when I discovered "free-association", offering what I feel confident in saying is a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other without any centralized control, planning, private-property or state intervention! 

It essentially unifies the concepts of mutual-aid, mutual-recognition, mutual-fulfillment, and surplus-distributionin in a single elegant equation that creates the mathematical foundations for a scalable gifting economy of co-creative abundance.

Now I am helping create an opensource & free p2p interface for this new economy.

Beyond post capitalist context am also a new babylonian architect, light sculpture enthusiast, dancer and lover of nature and the arts in general.
