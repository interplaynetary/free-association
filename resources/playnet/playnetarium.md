playnet: Distributed Free Association Residency

**Open call for all those interested in:** 

* ***Xorganizing***: *expressing* and *experimenting* with *organization*  
* Exploring playful and effective ways of organizing together  
* *Xorganizing* around your values, needs, and dependencies!  
* *Gain Access to Social-Material Coordination* in ways that align with your values!  
* *Free Association through Mutual Recognition*

**Who?** Artists, Activists, Architects, Ecologists, Economists, Festival Organizers, Organizations, Game Designers, Infiltrators, Hackers, Playwrights, Free Associators, Wildcards.  
**Distributed Network of Players** (No fixed number - organize through mutual recognition)

**Where?** Distributed across participant locations with optional central gathering points
**When?** Starting May 1-7, 2025 (flexible timeline based on local organization)

**Daily Rituals:** (Adaptable by each node in the network)

**ðŸŒž(Morning):** Local embodiment practices, meditation, breathing, movement - shared digitally across nodes

**Free-Association (Mid-day):**
* Recognize and analyze existing plays within your local space and network
* Map mutual contributions and dependencies locally and trans-locally
* Develop interfaces for expressing contributions, needs, and values

**Play Development (Evening):**
* Collaborative play creation through distributed channels
* Virtual mutual recognition sessions connecting all nodes
* Documentation and sharing of emerging social-material coordination patterns

**Resources Provided Through Mutual Recognition:** 

* Each participant expresses needs and surplus (space, materials, knowledge, money, etc.)
* Free-Association interface pairs surplus with needs based on mutual recognition
* Distributed resource mapping tools to make visible contribution flows
* Digital tools for remote play development and experimentation
* Local materials sourced through mutual recognition networks
* Money recognized as a legitimate need/desire within the free-association framework
* Documentation and guidebook for organizing playnet nodes

**Expected Effects:** 

* Distributed yet interconnected plays emerging through free-association  
* Increased capacity to recognize, read, (re)write, and perform plays across distances
* Multi-nodal network of **Social-Material-Plays** where contributors *mutually recognize* each other
* Practical examples of how free-association can organize material and social resources

**Program Phases:** (Implemented locally with trans-local coordination)

**Phase 1: Network Formation (Days 1-2)**
* Mapping local resources, needs, and contributions
* Establishing connections between distributed nodes based on mutual recognition
* Creating shared vocabulary and understanding of free-association principles
* Virtual and physical spaces linked through digital interfaces

**Phase 2: Play Development (Days 3-4)**
* Local and trans-local play development through mutual recognition interfaces
* Surplus roles identified and distributed through the network
* Experimentation with resource sharing across distributed nodes

**Phase 3: Implementation and Testing (Days 5-6)**
* Playing the plays locally while maintaining trans-local connections
* Real-time adjustment of distribution flows based on emerging needs
* Documentation of unexpected emergent properties and coordination patterns

**Phase 4: Network Reflection and Evolution (Day 7)**
* Analysis of how mutual recognition functioned across the distributed network
* Identification of barriers to free association and strategies for addressing them
* Planning for continued collaboration through free-association

**FREE ASSOCIATION Valued Effects:**   
*Augmented* **capacities** to organize **material resources** and **social coordination** through **mutual recognition** rather than centralized planning or market exchange.

**Metrics:**  
\- Number and diversity of **surplus roles** distributed through the network
\- Geographic distribution and connectivity of **participating nodes**
\- Total **needs fulfilled** through mutual recognition flows
\- Novel **plays and interfaces** developed for distributed free-association

**Contribution Flows:**  
\- **Money** as one form of contribution among many (not privileged)
\- **Space** shared through local nodes recognizing visiting contributors
\- **Knowledge** distributed through documentation and virtual sessions
\- **Materials** flowing through local and trans-local mutual recognition

**FRONTS:**  
\- **distributed-coordination** research
\- **material-need** mapping
\- **trans-local-recognition** development
\- **network-play** creation

**Participation Models:**

**Network Node Host:**
- Offer your space as a local playnet node
- Express your needs (money, materials, knowledge, etc.)
- Recognize contributions to your self-actualization

**Traveling Player:**
- Connect with multiple nodes based on mutual recognition
- Contribute to node hosts' self-actualization
- Access resources through genuine mutual contribution

**Remote Contributor:**
- Participate digitally in mutual recognition networks
- Offer surplus (money, knowledge, digital resources)
- Receive recognition for genuine contributions

**Economic Framework:**

Within free-association, money is recognized as a legitimate need/desire that can flow through mutual recognition networks. Rather than fixed fees:

- Each participant expresses their financial needs honestly
- Those with financial surplus recognize genuine contributors to their self-actualization
- Money flows according to mutual recognition, not predetermined rates
- Collective needs (like space rental for central gatherings) are met through aggregate mutual recognition

**Distributed yet Connected:**
playnet exists wherever participants establish nodes, connected through mutual recognition interfaces. No central authority determines where resources flow - distribution emerges from the genuine mutual recognition of real contributions toward each other's self-actualization.
