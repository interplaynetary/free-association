# Playnet: Distributed Free Association Residency

**Open call for all those interested in:** 

* ***Xorganizing***: *expressing* and *experimenting* with *organization*  
* Exploring playful and effective ways of organizing together  
* *Xorganizing* around your values, needs, and dependencies!  
* *Gain Access to Social-Material Coordination* in ways that align with your values/needs/desires/goals etc!  
* *Free Association through Mutual Recognition*

**Who?** Artists, Activists, Architects, Ecologists, Economists, Festival Organizers, Organizations, Game Designers, Infiltrators, Hackers, Playwrights, Free Associators, Wildcards.  
**Distributed Network of Players** (No fixed number - organize through mutual recognition)

**Where?** Distributed across participant locations with optional central gathering points
**When?** Starting May 1-7, 2025 (flexible timeline based on local organization)

**Daily Rituals:** (Adaptable by each node in the network)

**ðŸŒž(Morning):** Local embodiment practices, meditation, breathing, movement - shared digitally across nodes

**Free-Association (Mid-day):**
* Recognize and analyze existing plays within your local space and network
* Map mutual contributions and dependencies locally and trans-locally
* Develop interfaces for expressing contributions, needs, and values

**Play Development (Evening):**
* Collaborative play creation through distributed channels
* Virtual mutual recognition sessions connecting all nodes
* Documentation and sharing of emerging social-material coordination patterns
* Playtesting and performance of developed plays

**Resources Provided Through Mutual Recognition:** 

* Each participant expresses needs and surplus (space, materials, knowledge, money, etc.)
* Free-Association interface pairs surplus with needs based on mutual recognition
* Distributed resource mapping tools to make visible contribution flows
* Playthings for sustaining the state of play (body loops, flow sticks, cards, etc.)
* Digital tools for remote play development and experimentation
* Local materials sourced through mutual recognition networks
* A library of roles to organize playnet nodes based on free-association principles
* Documentation and guidebook for organizing playnet nodes

**Expected Effects:** 

* New and innovative plays that organize through free-association  
* Increased capacity of players to recognize, read, (re)write, and perform plays across distances
* Multi-nodal network of **Social-Material-Plays** where contributors *mutually recognize* each other
* Practical examples of how free-association can organize material and social resources
* A growing collection of plays that make visible and transform existing social patterns

**Program Phases:** (Implemented locally with trans-local coordination)

**Phase 1: Network Formation & Play Introduction (Days 1-2)**
* Mapping local resources, needs, and contributions
* Introduction to *recognizing*, *reading*, *(re)writing, and performing plays*
* Introduction to *context-role-casting* and *role-play requirements*
* Establishing connections between distributed nodes based on mutual recognition
* Creating shared vocabulary and understanding of free-association principles
* Virtual and physical spaces linked through digital interfaces

**Phase 2: Play Development (Days 3-4)**
* Local and trans-local play development through mutual recognition interfaces
* Individual and collaborative play development via plays for play-writing
* Surplus roles identified and distributed through the network
* Experimentation with different interfaces (analog/digital) for expressing mutual recognition
* Experimentation with resource sharing across distributed nodes

**Phase 3: Implementation and Testing (Days 5-6)**
* Prototyping and playtesting plays based on free-association principles
* Playing the plays locally while maintaining trans-local connections
* Real-time adjustment of distribution flows based on emerging needs
* Iterative refinement based on feedback and observed effects
* Documentation of unexpected emergent properties and coordination patterns

**Phase 4: Network Building & Integration (Day 7)**
* Introduction to **Social-Material-Plays** concepts across the network
* Exploration of valued effects/outcomes and contribution metrics
* Development of transitive mutual recognition networks
* Creation of play-to-play interfaces where surplus flows through networks of mutual recognition
* Analysis of how mutual recognition functioned across the distributed network
* Planning for continued collaboration through free-association

**FREE ASSOCIATION Valued Effects:**   
*Augmented* **capacities** of **players** to ***recognize, read***, ***(re)-write***, *and **perform*** **plays** based on mutual recognition of real contributions.

**Metrics:**  
\- *offered, accepted,* and *performed* **context-role-castings**  
\- diversity of **interfaces** *developed* and *utilized*  
\- density and reciprocity of **mutual recognition networks**  
\- flow of **surplus roles** through networks of free association
\- Number and diversity of **plays** created and performed
\- Geographic distribution and connectivity of **participating nodes**
\- Total **needs fulfilled** through mutual recognition flows

**Contribution Flows:**  
\- **Plays** that organize through free-association  
\- **Context-role-castings** distributed through mutual recognition  
\- **Money** as one form of contribution among many (not privileged)
\- **Space** shared through local nodes recognizing visiting contributors
\- **Knowledge** distributed through documentation and virtual sessions
\- **Materials** flowing through local and trans-local mutual recognition
\- **Documentation** of mutual recognition patterns

**FRONTS:**  
\- **Play development** and performance
\- **Mutual recognition mapping**  
\- **Material-research**  
\- **Distribution-research**  
\- **Interplayer-xorganization**
\- **Distributed-coordination** research
\- **Trans-local-recognition** development

**Participation Models:**

**Network Node Host:**
- Offer your space as a local playnet node
- Facilitate play development and performance
- Express your needs (money, materials, knowledge, etc.)
- Recognize contributions to your self-actualization

**Traveling Player:**
- Connect with multiple nodes based on mutual recognition
- Contribute to play development across nodes
- Contribute to node hosts' self-actualization
- Access resources through genuine mutual contribution

**Remote Contributor:**
- Participate digitally in mutual recognition networks
- Co-create plays through digital collaboration
- Offer surplus (money, knowledge, digital resources)
- Receive recognition for genuine contributions

**Economic Framework:**

Within free-association, money is recognized as a legitimate need/desire that can flow through mutual recognition networks. Rather than fixed fees:

- Each participant expresses their financial needs honestly
- Those with financial surplus recognize genuine contributors to their self-actualization
- Money flows according to mutual recognition, not predetermined rates
- Collective needs (like space rental for central gatherings) are met through aggregate mutual recognition

**Distributed yet Connected:**
Playnet exists wherever participants establish nodes, connected through mutual recognition interfaces. Each node becomes a testing ground for plays that make visible and transform our relationships. No central authority determines where resources flow - distribution emerges from the genuine mutual recognition of real contributions toward each other's self-actualization.
