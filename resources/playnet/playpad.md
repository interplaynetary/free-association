Playpadarium

**Open call for all those interested in:** 

* ***Xorganizing***: *expressing* and *experimenting* with *organization*  
* Exploring playful and effective ways of organizing together  
* *Xorganizing* around your values, needs, and dependencies!  
* *Gain Access to Social-Material Coordination* in ways that align with your values!  
* *Free Association through Mutual Recognition*

**Who?** Artists, Activists, Architects, Ecologists, Economists, Festival Organizers, Organizations, Game Designers, Infiltrators, Hackers, Playwrights, Free Associators, Wildcards.  
**Estimated 20 Players** 

**Where?** MOOS Space, Berlin 	**When?** May 1 2025

**Daily Ritual:** 

**ðŸŒž(Dawn):** Recovery from night activities, somatic practices, yoga, breathwork, meditation, and other embodiment practices.

**Free-Association (Morning):**

* Recognize and analyze existing plays within the space and beyond
* Explore mutual recognition and contribution mapping
* Develop interfaces for expressing contributions, needs, and values

**Play Development (Dusk):**

* Collaborative play creation and experimentation with emerging organizational forms
* Mutual recognition sessions to map interdependencies and contributions
* Documentation of emerging social-material coordination patterns

**Resources Provided:** 

* Physical spaces for play enactment and experimentation  
* Materials for creating interfaces for xorganizing play  
* Playthings for sustaining the state of play (body loops, flow sticks, cards, etc.)  
* Assistance in play-writing and free-association integration from experienced game designers, playwrights, and organizers.
* Mutual recognition mapping tools to visualize contribution networks
* Free-Association interfaces to distribute roles, access, and coordination according to mutual recognition
* A library of roles to organize the Playpadarium based on free-association principles.

**Expected Effects:** 

* New and innovative plays that organize through free-association  
* Increased capacity of players to recognize, read, (re)write, and perform plays  
* A network of interconnected **Social-Material-Plays** where contributors *mutually recognize* each other and distribute resources based on *real contributions to each other's self-actualization*.

**Program Phases:** 

**Phase 1: Introduction and Foundation (Day 1)**

* Introduction to *recognizing*, *reading*, *(re)writing, and performing plays*  
* Introduction to *context-role-casting* and *role-play requirements*  
* Mapping dependency networks and contribution flows
* Practice in mutual recognition and free-association

**Phase 2: Play Development (Days 2-3)**

* Individual and collaborative play development via plays for play-writing  
* Exploration of free-association mechanisms for distributing surplus roles
* Experimentation with different interfaces (analog/digital) for expressing mutual recognition

**Phase 3: Implementation and Testing (Days 4-5)**

* Prototyping and playtesting plays based on free-association principles  
* Iterative refinement based on feedback and observed effects
* Testing surplus role distribution through mutual recognition networks

**Phase 4: Network Building and Integration (Days 6-7)**

* Introduction to **Social-Material-Plays** concepts  
* Exploration of valued effects/outcomes and contribution metrics  
* Development of transitive mutual recognition networks  
* Creation of play-to-play interfaces where surplus flows through networks of mutual recognition

**FREE ASSOCIATION Valued Effects (Goals/Outcomes):**   
*Augment*ed **capacities** of **players** to ***recognize, read***, ***(re)-write***, *and **perform*** **plays** based on mutual recognition of real contributions.

**Metrics:**  
\- *offered, accepted,* and *performed* **context-role-castings**  
\- diversity of **interfaces** *developed* and *utilized*  
\- density and reciprocity of **mutual recognition networks**  
\- flow of **surplus roles** through networks of free association

**Contribution Flows:**  
\- **plays** that organize through free-association  
\- **context-role-castings** distributed through mutual recognition  
\- **documentation** of mutual recognition patterns  
\- **interfaces** for mapping contributions and dependencies
