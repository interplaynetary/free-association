# Proof and Strategy for a Truly Free Association of Free Individuals

We present a formulation of a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the *spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other* without any centralized control, planning, private-property or the state!

This requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.). 

**In this free association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

**Surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions, relations activate only through genuine desire and participation, and these properties persist even as relations compose into complex social structures.**

Simple math will reveal how in free association: false recognition/relations naturally decay while true recognition/relations strengthens - that recognition and social-relations organized on the basis of this free association necessarily tend towards social-material-truth.

---

**Let:**
- **One's Recognition** = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.)
- **One's Total-Recognition** = 100%

**For any participants A and B:**
1. A can (re)-attribute to B a share of A's total-recognition
2. B can (re)-attribute to A a share of B's total-recognition

**Let:**
- **Mutual-Recognition(A, B)** = min(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition,  A-share-of-B's-total-recognition) = Mutual-Contribution

*Taking the minimum of both shares ensures reciprocity in proportion* 

- **Association** = a set of relations where:
1. Each Relation consists of (Provider-Role, User-Role)
2. Each Role has a Holder who can:
   - Express Desire (Will to Play)
   - Express Playing (Active-Participation)
3. Relations become Active only when:
   - Both Role-Holders express Desire
   - Both Role-Holders express Playing
4. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties

**Let:**
- **Surplus** = Roles one holds but does not desire
   - Surplus can be distributed directly/transitively via Mutual-Recognition Distributions: **The share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

*"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"*

*The distribution of surplus-roles through networks of mutual-contribution is a form of distributed-peer-discovery/offering/matching! Finding collaborators who directly/transitively contribute to your self-actualization!*

**Let:**
- **Total Recognition = 100%**
- **Total Recognition = True Recognition + False Recognition**
- **Real Producers** = Those that actually perform the operations necessary to *transform* social-material reality in concrete-particular ways.

**For any participant:**
- ∴ ↑False Recognition = ↓True Recognition
- ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Surplus-Associations from Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Access to Real Social-Material Coordination via Surplus-Associations from Real Producers
- ∴ social-material-truth is realized through Free Association

**For any Association between A and B:**
- Mutual-Desire(A↔B) = Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A) 
- Mutual-Playing(A↔B) = Mutual-Desire(A↔B) ∧ Playing(A→B) ∧ Playing(B→A)

**Free Association requires:**
1. Mutual-Recognition > 0
2. Mutual-Desire (both parties genuinely desire the relation)
3. Mutual-Playing (both parties actively participate)
4. Access to Social-Material Coordination Necessary for Mutual-Playing

**For any participant:**
- ↓Real Contributions → ↓Real Mutual-Recognition
- ↓Real Mutual-Recognition → ↓Real Mutual-Desire
- ↓Real Mutual-Desire → ↓Real Mutual-Playing
- ↓Real Mutual-Playing → ↓Free Association
- ↓Free Association → ↓Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Producers

**Degrees of Free Association In Relations**

**Let:**
- MR = Mutual-Recognition [0,1]
- MD = Mutual-Desire [0,1]
- MP = Mutual-Playing [0,1]
- AC = Access to Social-Material Coordination Necessary for Mutual-Playing [0,1]

**Degree of Free Association (FA) = Harmonic Mean of Components:**
FA = 4 / (1/MR + 1/MD + 1/MP + 1/AC)

**Therefore for any participant:**
- ↓Any Component → ↓FA (disproportionately)
- ↑All Components → ↑FA
- FA approaches 1 only as all components approach 1
- FA approaches 0 if any component approaches 0

**For example:**
- If MR=1, MD=1, MP=1, but AC=0.1
  - FA ≈ 0.36 (weak despite three strong components)
- If MR=0.7, MD=0.7, MP=0.7, AC=0.7
  - FA = 0.7 (moderate but balanced association)

**This shows:**
- Free Association requires balanced development of all components
- Weakness in any component severely limits overall association
- Real social-material coordination is necessary for strong free-association
- Cannot compensate for weak components with strong ones

**On Capital Relations (and Coercive Relations in General) within Free Association:**

**Let:**
- Capitalist-Simulated-Production = Production appearing to come from capitalist but actually produced by producers!
- Commodity Fetish = The masking of social-material relations of production behind the veil of the product as commodity (market-relations) - the objective social-forgetting of the social-origin of things
- Second-Order-False-Recognition = False recognition given to obtain capital for buying labor-power

**For any participant C attempting capital accumulation via Second-Order-False-Recognition:**
1. ↑Second-Order-False-Recognition of Capital → ↑ Possibility of Mutual-Recognition with Capital Provider
2. ↑Capital → ↑Ability to Buy Labor-Power
3. ↑Bought Labor-Power → ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production
4. ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production → ↑Real Products
5. ↑Real Products → ↑Potential for Real Recognition from Others

**However, for Real Producers (A, B) whose labor-power has been bought by C:**
1. As A, B begin organizing on basis of Free Association:
   - ↑Recognition of mutual dependencies in production
   - ↑Recognition of potential direct association (A↔B)
   - ↑Pressure on C participate in production and make real-contributions
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - C's need to maintain capitalist claim to ownership of surplus and means of production
     - C's need to have contributions recognized by freely associating producers

2. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Labor-Power Purchased → ↑Potential for that Labor-Power to organize on the basis of Free Association
   - ↑Formation of Direct Producer Associations
   - ↑Visibility of real production dependencies
   - ↓Effectiveness of commodity fetish in masking relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization of bought labor-power via Free Association
- → ↑Internal pressure to reveal real internal production relations
- → ↓Internal recognition of Capitalist's claim surplus-production/distribution
- → ↑Recognition of direct producer dependencies
- ∴ Capital relations become increasingly unstable as bought labor-power organizes via Free Association

**In other words:**
The commodity fetish cannot persist when the labor-power being purchased begins organizing on the basis of Free Association, as this creates pressure to reveal real production relations. The commodity fetish, which normally masks social relations of production, cannot be maintained within Free Association because Free Association requires demonstration of real contribution, creating a contradiction that must resolve either through the loss of recognition of Capitalist-Simulated-Production or its dissolution into Free Association.

**On Free Association and State Power:**

**Let:**
- State-Power = The organized force appearing separate from and above producers
- State-Mediated Governance = Coordination via state apparatus rather than direct free association
- State-Simulated-Coordination = Coordination appearing to come from state but actually from producer self-organization
- State Fetish = The masking of real social-coordination behind the veil of state authority - the objective social-forgetting of the self-organizing capacity of producers
- Property Relations = Legal framework enforcing exclusive control over means of production
- Bourgoise Legal Fetish = The masking of class relations behind formal equality before the law

**For any state apparatus S attempting to maintain property relations:**
1. Initial state:
   - State power maintains property relations
   - Property relations restrict common utilization despite dissolution of particular capitalist organization
   - Coordination appears as coming from above
   - Social relations appear as legal relations

2. However, as free association expands:
   - ↑Scale of free association
   - ↑Number of producers organizing via free association
   - ↑Practical common utilization despite formal property relations
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - Legal property framework
     - Actual production relations

3. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Gap between formal ownership and real utilization
   - ↑Material power of associated producers
   - ↑Self-Coordination of Producers → ↓Need for State-Mediated-Governance
   - ↑Difficulty of enforcing private-property relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization via Free Association
- → ↑Visibility of real coordination capabilities
- → ↓Recognition of state's claim to necessary coordination role
- → ↑Recognition of producer self-organization capacity
- ∴ State power becomes increasingly superfluous as producers organize via Free Association

**In other words:**
The state fetish cannot persist when producers organize via Free Association, as this demonstrates their real capacity for self-coordination. State power, which normally appears as necessary external force, reveals itself as superfluous when Free Association shows producers' capacity to coordinate their own social-material production.

**Therefore:**
- ∴ State power isn't abolished but withers away as its functions are increasingly rendered unnecessary in Free Association
- ∴ The social-coordination of things replaces the government of persons
- ∴ Free Association realizes both social and material self-governance of producers

**Therefore**
- ∴ (↑Dissolution of capitalist organization into Free Association ∧ ↓Effectiveness of state power in maintaining private-property relations) → ↓Force of the limits imposed by organizational-forms-based-on-class-division on the utilization of means of production in common by Freely Associating Producers
- ∴ ↑Means of production in common → ↑Access to Materials Necessary for Playing Associations
- ∴ ↑Truly Free Association (both socially and materially)

**Definitions:**
- Direct Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B (A and B directly contribute to each other)
- Transitive Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and B transitively contribute to each other via B)

**Let us imagine, for a change, a directly/transitively mutualistic truly free association of free individuals, spontaneously coordinating their social-material production with the means of production in common, without any centralized control or planning. Without the need for private-property or the state.**

*"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime desire; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"* (Marx)

***Freedom* and *necessity* are not opposed but united in the free association of producers.**

**When individuals freely contribute to each other's self-actualization, when surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions, when relations activate only through genuine desire and participation - then we have finally a form in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all!**

*"Communism as the positive transcendence of private property as human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being – a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man – the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution."* (Marx)

*"The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The state is not "abolished", it withers away."* (Engels)

*"The society which organizes production anew on the basis of free and equal association of the producers will put the whole state machinery where it will then belong—into the museum of antiquities, next to the spinning wheel and the bronze axe."* (Engels)

In the approach to woman as the spoil and hand-maid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself, for the secret of this approach has its unambiguous, decisive, plain and undisguised expression in the relation of man to woman and in the manner in which the direct and natural species-relationship is conceived. The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman. In this natural species-relationship man’s relation to nature is immediately his relation to man, just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature – his own natural destination. In this relationship, therefore, is sensuously manifested, reduced to an observable fact, the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man, or to which nature to him has become the human essence of man. From this relationship one can therefore judge man’s whole level of development. From the character of this relationship follows how much man as a species-being, as man, has come to be himself and to comprehend himself; the relation of man to woman is the most natural relation of human being to human being. It therefore reveals the extent to which man’s natural behaviour has become human, or the extent to which the human essence in him has become a natural essence – the extent to which his human nature has come to be natural to him. This relationship also reveals the extent to which man’s need has become a human need; the extent to which, therefore, the other person as a person has become for him a need – the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being.

The abolition [Aufhebung] of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and qualities, but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, human. The eye has become a human eye, just as its object has become a social, human object – an object made by man for man. The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians. They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man, [In practice I can relate myself to a thing humanly only if the thing relates itself humanly to the human being. – Note by Marx] and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost its egotistical nature, and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use.


In the same way, the senses and enjoyment of other men have become my own appropriation. Besides these direct organs, therefore, social organs develop in the form of society; thus, for instance, activity in direct association with others, etc., has become an organ for expressing my own life, and a mode of appropriating human life.

It is obvious that the human eye enjoys things in a way different from the crude, non-human eye; the human ear different from the crude ear, etc.

We have seen that man does not lose himself in his object only when the object becomes for him a human object or objective man. This is possible only when the object becomes for him a social object, he himself for himself a social being, just as society becomes a being for him in this object.


On the one hand, therefore, it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man’s essential powers – human reality, and for that reason the reality of his own essential powers – that all objects become for him the objectification of himself, become objects which confirm and realise his individuality, become his objects: that is, man himself becomes the object. The manner in which they become his depends on the nature of the objects and on the nature of the essential power corresponding to it; for it is precisely the determinate nature of this relationship which shapes the particular, real mode of affirmation. To the eye an object comes to be other than it is to the ear, and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the ear. The specific character of each essential power is precisely its specific essence, and therefore also the specific mode of its objectification, of its objectively actual, living being. Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking, ||VIII| but with all his senses.

On the other hand, let us look at this in its subjective aspect. Just as only music awakens in man the sense of music, and just as the most beautiful music has no sense for the unmusical ear – is [no] object for it, because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers – it can therefore only exist for me insofar as my essential power exists for itself as a subjective capacity; because the meaning of an object for me goes only so far as my sense goes (has only a meaning for a sense corresponding to that object) – for this reason the senses of the social man differ from those of the non-social man. Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man’s essential being is the richness of subjective human sensibility (a musical ear, an eye for beauty of form – in short, senses capable of human gratification, senses affirming themselves as essential powers of man) either cultivated or brought into being. For not only the five senses but also the so-called mental senses, the practical senses (will, love, etc.), in a word, human sense, the human nature of the senses, comes to be by virtue of its object, by virtue of humanised nature. The forming of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present. The sense caught up in crude practical need has only a restricted sense.> For the starving man, it is not the human form of food that exists, but only its abstract existence as food. It could just as well be there in its crudest form, and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding activity differs from that of animals. The care-burdened, poverty-stricken man has no sense for the finest play; the dealer in minerals sees only the commercial value but not the beauty and the specific character of the mineral: he has no mineralogical sense. Thus, the objectification of the human essence, both in its theoretical and practical aspects, is required to make man’s sense human, as well as to create the human sense corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance.

<Just as through the movement of private property, of its wealth as well as its poverty – of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty – the budding society finds at hand all the material for this development, so established society produces man in this entire richness of his being produces the rich man profoundly endowed with all the senses – as its enduring reality.>

We see how subjectivity and objectivity, spirituality and materiality, activity [Tätigkeit] and suffering, lose their antithetical character, and – thus their existence as such antitheses only within the framework of society; <we see how the resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible in a practical way, by virtue of the practical energy of man. Their resolution is therefore by no means merely a problem of understanding, but a real problem of life, which philosophy could not solve precisely because it conceived this problem as merely a theoretical one.

"Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations." (The German Ideology)

# Interface:
- Ruzgar: A p2p interface (a single html file) is being created for peers to express their mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.) and to distribute associations (mutual-relations) according to their mutual-recognition-distributions. Implementing all the logic presented in this proof. 

It is being developed open-source at [interplaynetary-github](https://github.com/interplaynetary/free association) but is additionally available p2p on [radicl](https://link-needed).

**A basic interface for free association is almost complete but we are seeking support in user-interface-development as well as support in the form of housing, food etc.**
