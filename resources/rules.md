# **The Free-Association Play Rules**

## `STARTING THE GAME üéÆ`

`Welcome, player!`   
`Your Mission: Play together to help everyone (including yourself) become their most authentic, thriving self!`

`You begin with:`

- **`Your Recognition Power: 100%`** `- This is yours alone, never loses strength, cannot be traded`  
- **`Divisible Capacities`**`: Time, energy, attention, skills - these you can share and divide`  
- **`Indivisible Capacities`**`: Love, respect, trust, wonder - these can only be given whole and multiply when shared`

## `THE CORE PLAY MECHANICS`

### `Your Basic Movesüëë`

*`The fundamental ways you can interact with other players`*

**`Universal Moves (work with everyone):`**

- **`Honor Dignity`**`: See and treat everyone as a complete person worthy of respect`  
- **`Play Fair`**`: Only use strategies you'd be happy for everyone to use`  
- **`Respect Choice`**`: Never force or manipulate other players' decisions`

**`Divisible Capacities:`**

- **`Keep Promises`**`: When sharing time/skills/stuff, only commit what you can actually give`  
- **`Share with Care`**`: Give your finite resources in ways that honor who's receiving them`

**`Your Indivisible Capacity Powers:`**

- **`Love Completely`**`: When you love, respect, or trust someone - give it fully, don't hold back`  
- **`Keep Your Heart Pure`**`: Never use love, respect or trust as bargaining chips or weapons`

### `Recognition MechanicsüéØ`

*`How you acknowledge the awesome ways other players help you flourish`*

**`Your Recognition Distribution:`**

- `You have exactly 100% Total-Recognition to distribute however you choose`  
- `This represents: "Who helps me become my best self?"`  
- `You can change your mind anytime as you grow and relationships evolve`

**`The Mutual Recognition Formula:`**  
`Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = minimum(`  
    `Your-Recognition-of-Them,`   
    `Their-Recognition-of-You`  
`)`  
*`Example: If you give them 30% of your recognition, and they give you 20% of theirs, your Mutual Recognition = 20%`*

**`Priority Choices:`**

- `Since you have finite attention and energy, you must choose who gets your focus`  
- `Your 100% recognition shows your current "priorities for flourishing"`  
- `Play authentically - recognize those who genuinely help you thrive!`

### `Sharing Your Capacities üéÅ`

*`How your abilities and resources flow to help others flourish`*

**`Divisible Capacity Sharing (time, skills, resources):`**

`Your-Share(Provider's-Capacity) =`   
    `Mutual-Recognition(You, Provider) √∑ Provider's-Total-Mutual-Recognition`

*`Example: If your Mutual Recognition with Sarah is 15%, and Sarah's total Mutual Recognition with everyone is 60%, then your share of Sarah's capacities = 15% √∑ 60% = 25%`*

**`Coordination Features:`**

- **`Availability Slot Coordination`**`: Arrange specific times and places to share capacities together`  
- **`Context Matters`**`: Keep track of when, where, and how much you're sharing`

**`Indivisible Capacity Sharing:`**

- **`Give Complete Love/Respect`**`: Each person gets your full love - it doesn't get divided up`  
- **`Love Multiplies`**`: Loving one person more doesn't mean loving others less`  
- **`Create Abundance`**`: The more you give these indivisible capacities, the more everyone has!`

### `Network Effects ‚ú®`

*`How the whole game creates amazing possibilities`*

**`The Six-Degrees Superpower:`**  
`Access-Strength(You, Distant-Provider) =`   
    `Product of all Mutual-Recognition-Ratios along shortest path`

*`Example: You ‚Üí Friend (40% MR) ‚Üí Their Friend (30% MR) ‚Üí Distant Provider (50% MR)`*  
*`Your access strength = 40% √ó 30% √ó 50% = 6% of distant provider's capacity`*

- `You're connected to EVERY HUMAN through at most 6 steps of relationships`  
- `This means you have potential access to all human creativity and surplus!`  
- `Each new authentic relationship exponentially increases what's available to you`

**`The Truth Advantage:`**  
`Your-Total-Recognition = True-Recognition + False-Recognition`  
`‚à¥ ‚ÜëFalse-Recognition = ‚ÜìTrue-Recognition`  
`‚à¥ ‚ÜìAccess to Actually-Beneficial-Capacities`  
`‚à¥ Mathematical pressure toward authenticity!`

- **`If you fake recognition`**`: You lose access to people who actually help you flourish`  
- **`If you give authentic recognition`**`: You gain access to genuine abundance`  
- `The game mathematically rewards honesty and punishes deception!`

**`Network Evolution:`**

- `Fake relationships naturally fade away (they don't provide real value)`  
- `Authentic relationships strengthen over time`  
- `The whole network evolves toward truth and mutual flourishing`

## `WINNING CONDITIONS üèÜ`

**`Personal Victory:`**

- `You're authentically flourishing and helping others do the same`  
- `Your recognition relationships are real and life-giving`  
- `You're playing with integrity in all your moves`

**`Collective Victory:`**

- `Everyone's individual flourishing helps everyone else flourish too`  
- `The network is stable, abundant, and truthful`  
- `We've proven that authenticity mathematically beats manipulation`

## `POWER-UPS & SPECIAL ABILITIES üöÄ`

**`Truth Mastery`**`: The more authentic your recognition, the more access you gain to amazing capacities`   
**`Network Mastery`**`: Each genuine relationship multiplies your access to human creativity`   
**`Heart Mastery`**`: The more completely you give your indivisible capacities (love/respect), the more these capacities flow through the whole network`   
**`Flow Mastery`**`: Playing with integrity makes you undefeatable`
