The mathematics of mutual recognition "shares" determining surplus "sharing" creates a self-reinforcing cycle where the noun and verb forms continuously generate each other—your shares in my surplus exist precisely because I'm sharing with you based on our mutual recognition.

The linguistic trope could be extended throughout the Free Association interface and documentation. Different types of sharing could generate specialized share terminologies—"care-shares" for mutual emotional support, "skill-shares" for knowledge transfer, "space-shares" for housing distribution—creating an intuitive taxonomy of contribution types. Visualization tools could represent one's "share network" showing both direct and transitive sharing relationships, with potential gamification elements encouraging diverse sharing experiences. Even the mathematical operations could be named to emphasize their sharing dynamics—"share-flow calculations," "mutual-share amplification," or "transitive-share pathways."
