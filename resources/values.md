# Playnet Values

## Core Design Principles
- **modularity**: design systems as separate components that can be combined in various ways
- **interoperability**: ensure different systems can connect and work together seamlessly
- **(re)-composability**: allow components to be taken apart and recombined in new configurations
- **simplicity**: favor simple solutions over complex ones
- **selection-pressure:** expose ideas to real-world conditions early and often
- **fit-for-purpose:** design for actual use cases rather than theoretical perfection

## Collaboration Dynamics
- **permissionless innovation**: allow experimentation without centralized approval
- **stigmergic coordination**: enable indirect collaboration through shared environments
- **granularity**: break work into small, manageable units for distributed participation
- **intrinsic motivation**: design systems that engage diverse motivational drivers
- **transaction cost reduction**: minimize barriers to participation and contribution
- **large-scale collaboration**: enable productive interaction among increasing numbers of people
- **emergent-network-intelligence**: allow complex coordination to arise from simple rules

## Individual and Relational Ethics
- **bodily autonomy**: respect each person's right to control their own body and boundaries
- **self-determination**: support each person's right to define their own identity and desires
- **enthusiastic consent**: value active, ongoing agreement rather than mere absence of refusal
- **voluntary-participation**: ensure relations activate only through mutual desire and consent
- **pleasure-affirmation**: recognize pleasure as a legitimate goal and right for all people
- **shame-rejection**: actively work to eliminate harmful social stigmas around desire and expression
- **honest communication**: prioritize transparent expression of needs, desires, and boundaries
- **power-consciousness**: acknowledge and address power differentials in all relationships
- **inclusivity**: embrace diverse bodies, identities, orientations, and relationship structures
- **harm-reduction**: focus on minimizing potential negative consequences without judgment

## Networks and Mutual Recognition
- **contribution recognition**: acknowledge those who contribute to one's own development
- **mutual recognition**: prioritize reciprocal relationships where recognition flows both ways
- **non-ownership relations**: ensure individuals remain free from being owned by others in any way (debt/obligation etc.)
- **present over past**: allow recognition to adjust based on current rather than historical contributions
- **proportional equivalence**: ensure fair relationship between contributions and benefits
- **transitive contribution**: enable surplus to flow through networks to indirect contributors
- **network resilience**: strengthen connections that enable surplus to flow where most needed
- **liberation-orientation**: connect personal freedoms to collective struggles against oppression

## Commons Governance
- **boundary definition**: clearly articulate who can access and modify resources
- **collective stewardship**: ensure communities stewardship over shared resources
- **monitoring systems**: develop effective ways to track resource conditions and user behavior
- **graduated sanctions**: implement proportional responses to rule violations
- **conflict resolution**: provide accessible mechanisms for addressing disagreements
- **veto rights**: recognize legitimate authority to challenge harmful decisions
- **continuous adaptation**: adjust rules in response to changing conditions
- **open-accessibility**: ensure information flows freely between system components
- **transparency**: make system behavior observable and understandable
- **knowledge-sharing**: facilitate exchange of ideas and learning across boundaries
- **non-rival resources**: design for abundance rather than scarcity

## Adaptive Systems Design
- **antifragility**: design systems that gain from disorder and volatility
  - convexity-first: prioritize improving payoff structure over knowledge acquisition
  - diversification: spread resources across many small trials rather than few large ones
  - serial-optionality: maintain flexibility with short-term plans and frequent exit points
  - negative-knowledge: learn from failures and document what doesn't work
  - opportunistic-adaptation: invest in agents who can pivot and exploit opportunities









----

Separation of concerns - Divide responsibilities into distinct sections
Loose coupling - Minimize dependencies between components
High cohesion - Group related functionalities together
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - Avoid duplication of knowledge/effort

Single responsibility principle - Each component should do one thing well
Interface segregation - Provide specific interfaces rather than general ones

Fail fast - Surface errors early and visibly

Abstraction - Hide implementation details behind clear interfaces

Graceful degradation - Maintain basic functionality when components fail

Feature toggles - Allow features to be switched on/off without redeployment

Chaos engineering - Deliberately introduce failures to build resilience

Orthogonality - Changes in one component shouldn't affect unrelated components

Statelessness - Design components without internal state when possible
