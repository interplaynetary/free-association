excerpts from a convo where i was asked "what do you mean by value"


how i draw the distinction between personal and private:
- private property: based on ownership (regardless of use)
- personal property: based on mutual-recognition that someone is using something (use does not mean direct consumption in the present, but even that the object plays a role in one's plans, i.e. even if i am not using my laptop right now, it is playing a role in my plans to code) - it is more relational, and vibe based


private property, isnt even the right to use a thing as one-wishes (rules, laws, conventions, limit the possible uses of objects)

it is the right to prevent all others from using a thing. interesting that when marx talked about private property, in german it was a *verb* the act of privatizing, of negating all others, the rest of social-reality from use.

private-property is not just a thing, it is a social-relation between people determining how they relate to thing


i support the mantainence of enforcement of personal property relations! but not private ones, some of what we call private property is also personal (but the overlap is not justificatif of private property itself)


recognizing/acknowledging their contribution to my self-actualization


also interesting is that in markets, exchange-value is expressed i relative-ratios (3-apple, for 1 bananas,  3:1 ratio) and then the exchange of these with money : facilitating exchange, as the universal common denominator, then leads to masses of labor, objects, etc. that are valued as a % of the total monetary mass of abstract-universal-exchange-value.

money in this society acts as a way of socially-validating and recognizing the contributions of people.

It is the right to express social-value (through the medium of exchange - of course what can be valued in this frame is limited by - what can be bought as commodity - gifting is exception - commodity production go brrrrrrr)

The transferability of recognition in the form of objects/tokens/money - is the condition of possibility of the accumulation of recognition in general.

It is because recognition is transferable and thus accumulatable, in massive disproportions, that we are able to socially-value the military industry. (few individuals have the overwhelming power to say what is considered valuable - and of course part of what they can overwhelmingly value is those industries that protect their property rights - and reproduce the matrix)

most of us get paid for our labor (in one way or another, we get the money we need to survive), and lets say i got enough to buy a sandwhich! Yay! society validated my labor! i got paid! i did something useful! I have the right to express my values!

I really like this sandwhich! I bought it so i cud survive, in getting access to the use, i now let go of the object which permit me to express value, and it is accumulated to the sandwhich shop owner! who then uses it to buy my labor !

In free-assoc no one can ever take your power to recognize and express the value of contributions to the reality, mutual-rec is the mutual-validation of eachothers contributions, and you own 100% of yourself. you have the inalienable right to express your values, and to freely-associate with others towards their realization. And no one can take that away from you, Moreover u can value anything, u r not limited to only being able to value commodities, you can value solving climate change, not just buying aircondtioners!


something id emphasize is that *we dont have to have the same values or ontology in order to contribute effectively towards eachothers self-actualization*

we can have wildly different values and still interoperate. thats part of what makes money so universal is how it collapses everything into a number and then the numbers talk (natural numbers)

free-assoc gets the same kind of interoperability/universality features, but with percentaages instead of natural numbers


as for interoperability! u can see i can value contributions of giving money! or mantaining personal property relations!


u cud even value, the mantainance of private-property relations! (i dont) but if free-assoc expands some ppl certainly will


but they will find it will be hard to have as fulfilling mutual-relations when allocating more recognition towards a value whose inherent principle is the exclusion of all others


But this makes sense as a function. For if everyone could use a house with no boundary separation the house would lose value over time and the people that can hold it with social power or violence would end up essentially owning it. If someone could use my laptop but left it in a precarious place and wasn’t attached to the value it was exchanged for, if it got broken by someone else they’d be resistant to replacing it and bearing the cost (unless you were choosy about who uses it or had agreements up front)


this is why recognition is mutual, the laptop doesnt just get shared randomly, it gets shared with mutual-contributors, this already embeds directly the whole logic of reproduction and care


fixing the laptop etc.


thats why we were also talking about how we replace the airbnb economy


the ppl living are also the ppl taking care of the space


we arent just hiring cleaners with our airbnb money

The Fundamental Distinction Between Personal and Private Property
The text establishes a crucial conceptual framework distinguishing personal property from private property based on fundamentally different organizing principles. Personal property emerges from mutual recognition of use and relational engagement - it's "vibe based" and acknowledges that someone is actively using something or that it plays a role in their plans and self-actualization. This contrasts sharply with private property, which is defined purely by ownership regardless of use. The author reveals that private property isn't even primarily about the right to use something, but rather the right to exclude all others from use - it's fundamentally a negative relation, a power of negation over social reality.
Private Property as Social Relation and Act of Negation
Drawing on Marx's German conceptualization, the text reveals private property as fundamentally a verb - an active process of privatizing, of negating others from use. This insight transforms our understanding from seeing property as a thing to recognizing it as a social relation between people that determines how they relate to things. Private property becomes visible as an ongoing social process of exclusion rather than a static legal category. This reframing exposes the violence inherent in private property relations - not just the violence of enforcement, but the conceptual violence of organizing social reality around the principle of excluding others from the material basis of their existence.
Money as Transferable Recognition and the Accumulation Problem
The analysis reveals money's dual function as both a medium of social validation and a mechanism for accumulating recognition. In market societies, money serves as "the right to express social-value," allowing people to validate contributions and express values through exchange. However, the transferability of this recognition creates the possibility for massive accumulation in disproportionate amounts. This transferability becomes "the condition of possibility of the accumulation of recognition in general," enabling some individuals to accumulate overwhelming power to determine what society values - including valuing industries that protect their own property rights, creating a self-reinforcing system.
The Sandwich Shop Dialectic and Labor Circulation
Through the simple example of buying a sandwich, the text illuminates a profound circularity in capitalist relations. The worker receives money (social validation) for their labor, uses it to survive by purchasing a sandwich, and in doing so transfers their power to express value to the shop owner, who then uses that accumulated power to purchase the worker's labor. This creates a closed loop where workers' own social validation is accumulated by capital owners and used to purchase the workers themselves. The worker's recognition of their own contribution becomes the means of their own subordination.
Free Association as Inalienable Recognition
Free association emerges as a radical alternative where "no one can ever take your power to recognize and express the value of contributions to reality." Unlike money-mediated recognition that can be accumulated and transferred, mutual recognition in free association remains inalienable - "you own 100% of yourself." This creates a fundamentally different social relation where recognition cannot be separated from the recognizer, preventing the accumulation dynamics that characterize capitalist social relations. The system expands what can be valued beyond commodities to include contributions like "solving climate change, not just buying air conditioners."
Universality Through Percentages Rather Than Natural Numbers
The text identifies a crucial technical innovation: free association achieves the same universality and interoperability as money, but through percentages rather than natural numbers. This seemingly simple shift has profound implications. While money creates universality by reducing all qualitative differences to quantitative exchange ratios, free association creates universality through proportional recognition that maintains qualitative differences. People can have "wildly different values and still interoperate" because the system operates through relative recognition rather than absolute accumulation.
The Self-Correcting Nature of False Recognition
A sophisticated analysis emerges around how false recognition naturally decays in free association. Since total recognition always equals 100%, any increase in false recognition necessarily decreases true recognition, which reduces mutual recognition with actually beneficial contributors, which reduces access to actually beneficial surplus. This creates a mathematical necessity where "social-material-truth is processually realized in Free-Association by processual social-material negation of False-Recognition." The system becomes self-correcting toward truth through its own internal dynamics rather than external enforcement.
Mutual Recognition and the Logic of Care
The text reveals how mutual recognition inherently embeds "the whole logic of reproduction and care." When a laptop is shared with mutual contributors rather than randomly, the sharing relationship already contains the motivation for maintenance and care. This contrasts with both private property (where care is motivated by ownership) and commons without mutual recognition (where care becomes a collective action problem). The mutual recognition relationship creates organic incentives for care because contributors are invested in each other's capacity for contribution.
Interoperability Across Value Systems
Perhaps most remarkably, the text suggests that free association can accommodate even those who value private property relations, though they "will find it hard to have as fulfilling mutual-relations when allocating more recognition towards a value whose inherent principle is the exclusion of all others." This reveals free association not as a dogmatic system requiring ideological conformity, but as a mathematical framework that can accommodate diverse values while naturally selecting for those that enhance rather than diminish mutual flourishing.
Replacing Extractive Economies with Integrated Care
The final insight connects to replacing extractive economic models like Airbnb with integrated care models where "the people living are also the people taking care of the space." This represents a fundamental shift from economies based on separation (owners/users, providers/consumers, workers/beneficiaries) to economies based on integration where use and care, contribution and benefit, become unified rather than separated. This integration eliminates the need for external enforcement or management because the relationships themselves contain their own reproductive logic.
