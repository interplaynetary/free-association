excerpts from a convo where i was asked "what do you mean by value"


how i draw the distinction between personal and private:
- private property: based on ownership (regardless of use)
- personal property: based on mutual-recognition that someone is using something (use does not mean direct consumption in the present, but even that the object plays a role in one's plans, i.e. even if i am not using my laptop right now, it is playing a role in my plans to code) - it is more relational, and vibe based


private property, isnt even the right to use a thing as one-wishes (rules, laws, conventions, limit the possible uses of objects)

it is the right to prevent all others from using a thing. interesting that when marx talked about private property, in german it was a *verb* the act of privatizing, of negating all others, the rest of social-reality from use.

private-property is not just a thing, it is a social-relation between people determining how they relate to thing


i support the mantainence of enforcement of personal property relations! but not private ones, some of what we call private property is also personal (but the overlap is not justificatif of private property itself)


recognizing/acknowledging their contribution to my self-actualization


also interesting is that in markets, exchange-value is expressed i relative-ratios (3-apple, for 1 bananas,  3:1 ratio) and then the exchange of these with money : facilitating exchange, as the universal common denominator, then leads to masses of labor, objects, etc. that are valued as a % of the total monetary mass of abstract-universal-exchange-value.

money in this society acts as a way of socially-validating and recognizing the contributions of people.

It is the right to express social-value (through the medium of exchange - of course what can be valued in this frame is limited by - what can be bought as commodity - gifting is exception - commodity production go brrrrrrr)

The transferability of recognition in the form of objects/tokens/money - is the condition of possibility of the accumulation of recognition in general.

It is because recognition is transferable and thus accumulatable, in massive disproportions, that we are able to socially-value the military industry. (few individuals have the overwhelming power to say what is considered valuable - and of course part of what they can overwhelmingly value is those industries that protect their property rights - and reproduce the matrix)

most of us get paid for our labor (in one way or another, we get the money we need to survive), and lets say i got enough to buy a sandwhich! Yay! society validated my labor! i got paid! i did something useful! I have the right to express my values!

I really like this sandwhich! I bought it so i cud survive, in getting access to the use, i now let go of the object which permit me to express value, and it is accumulated to the sandwhich shop owner! who then uses it to buy my labor !

In free-assoc no one can ever take your power to recognize and express the value of contributions to the reality, mutual-rec is the mutual-validation of eachothers contributions, and you own 100% of yourself. you have the inalienable right to express your values, and to freely-associate with others towards their realization. And no one can take that away from you, Moreover u can value anything, u r not limited to only being able to value commodities, you can value solving climate change, not just buying aircondtioners!


something id emphasize is that *we dont have to have the same values or ontology in order to contribute effectively towards eachothers self-actualization*

we can have wildly different values and still interoperate. thats part of what makes money so universal is how it collapses everything into a number and then the numbers talk (natural numbers)

free-assoc gets the same kind of interoperability/universality features, but with percentaages instead of natural numbers


as for interoperability! u can see i can value contributions of giving money! or mantaining personal property relations!


u cud even value, the mantainance of private-property relations! (i dont) but if free-assoc expands some ppl certainly will


but they will find it will be hard to have as fulfilling mutual-relations when allocating more recognition towards a value whose inherent principle is the exclusion of all others


But this makes sense as a function. For if everyone could use a house with no boundary separation the house would lose value over time and the people that can hold it with social power or violence would end up essentially owning it. If someone could use my laptop but left it in a precarious place and wasn’t attached to the value it was exchanged for, if it got broken by someone else they’d be resistant to replacing it and bearing the cost (unless you were choosy about who uses it or had agreements up front)


this is why recognition is mutual, the laptop doesnt just get shared randomly, it gets shared with mutual-contributors, this already embeds directly the whole logic of reproduction and care


fixing the laptop etc.


thats why we were also talking about how we replace the airbnb economy


the ppl living are also the ppl taking care of the space


we arent just hiring cleaners with our airbnb money
