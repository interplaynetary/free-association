# Naluʻea Living Trust - Restructured with Free-Association Frameworks

## Framework Integration Overview

This restructuring uses three computational frameworks to replace centralized governance:

1. **Membership Module (MRD)**: Determines who participates based on mutual recognition density
2. **Collective Recognition**: Allocates resources based on recognized needs and mutual recognition
3. **Decider**: Structured group decisions (used minimally, only for strategic/constitutional decisions)

---

## 1. Core Concept

**Definition**: A meta-architecture (trust of trusts) for planetary bioregional development
- Decentralized network of legally sovereign, spiritually aligned trusts
- Each trust is rooted in a specific bioregion (ecological boundaries, not political)
- Bioregions defined by watersheds, river basins, aquifers, and natural boundaries

**Purpose**: Fund holistic community transformation through regenerative models

---

## 2. Trust Architecture

### 2.1 Horizontal Model: Community Transformation
- Based on Wheel of Co-Creation (12 domains)
- Domains: Land/Housing, Food, Water, Energy, Culture/Language, Health, Education, Economy, Governance
- Communities funded as complete ecosystems, not individual projects
- Returns flow as reciprocity (not debt) to seed next bioregions
- Guided by Planetary Party Protocol and Kuleana principles

### 2.2 Systemic Pathways (Verticals)
Each community activates across sectors:

1. **Clothing & Materials**: Regenerative supply chains, natural fibers, circular design, community cooperatives
2. **Healing & Health**: Ancestral medicine, trauma healing, medicinal plants, wellness centers
3. **Food & Water**: Agroecology, water stewardship, bioregional supply chains, seed libraries, rainwater harvesting
4. **Shelter & Sacred Space**: Natural building materials, community dwellings, regenerative architecture
5. **Education & Learning**: Land-based learning, elder-youth transmission, bioregional curriculum, guild apprenticeships
6. **Energy & Mobility**: Microgrids, renewable energy cooperatives, clean mobility, bioregional energy sovereignty
7. **Culture, Arts & Story**: Ancestral storytelling, bioregional arts, sacred media, youth-led culture creation

---

## 3. Participation & Membership

### 3.1 Membership Determination (Replaces Manual Acceptance)

**USES: Membership Module (MRD)**

**Previous approach**: Initiation ceremonies, declarations, manual approval
**New approach**: Computational membership through mutual recognition density

#### How It Works:

**Individual Stewards:**
```
1. Participants recognize each other's contributions (0-100%)
2. Mutual Recognition = min(Recognition(A→B), Recognition(B→A))
3. MutualRecognitionScore = Σ all mutual recognitions with current members
4. MRD = MutualRecognitionScore / NetworkAverage
5. IsMember = MRD ≥ 0.5 (threshold)
```

**What this replaces:**
- ❌ "Receive initiation ceremony witnessed by existing Trust steward"
- ❌ "Identify role (Flamekeeper, Tech Weaver, etc.)"
- ❌ "Receive Scroll of Alignment"
- ❌ Manual onboarding gatekeeping

**What this enables:**
- ✓ Membership emerges from genuine mutual recognition of contributions
- ✓ No central authority deciding who belongs
- ✓ Natural onboarding path (participants can see their MRD rising toward threshold)
- ✓ Self-correcting for disengagement (low recognition → loss of membership)
- ✓ Protection against Sybil attacks and gaming

**Example:**
```
Alice contributes to Water Unity Network project
Bob (existing member) recognizes Alice: 12%
Charlie (existing member) recognizes Alice: 8%
Dave (existing member) recognizes Alice: 15%

Alice recognizes Bob: 10% → Mutual: 10%
Alice recognizes Charlie: 7% → Mutual: 7%
Alice recognizes Dave: 14% → Mutual: 14%

Alice's MutualRecognitionScore = 10% + 7% + 14% = 31%

If NetworkAverage = 45%, then:
MRD(Alice) = 31% / 45% = 0.69

Since 0.69 ≥ 0.5 threshold → Alice is a member
```

### 3.2 Membership Levels & Contexts

**Different membership contexts:**

1. **Trust Network Member**: High-level membership in meta-trust
   - Threshold: 0.5 (default)
   - Computed: Weekly
   - Determines: Ability to participate in collective recognition across entire network

2. **Bioregional Hub Member**: Membership within specific bioregion
   - Threshold: 0.4 (more inclusive locally)
   - Computed: Weekly
   - Determines: Participation in local resource allocation

3. **Project Contributor**: Membership within specific initiative
   - Threshold: 0.3 (most inclusive)
   - Computed: Daily or weekly
   - Determines: Project-level decision participation

4. **Legacy Donor/Funder**: Separate pathway (see 3.3)

**Roles emerge naturally:**
- Water Tender, Seed Steward, etc. are not assigned
- Roles emerge from what contributions people are recognized for
- Recognition data can be tagged: "Alice: 15% (water stewardship work)"
- System shows what each person is primarily recognized for

### 3.3 Legacy Donors & Funders (Special Case)

**These participants provide capital but may not contribute operational work.**

**Hybrid approach:**
- Financial contributions create automatic recognition boost (e.g., $10K = 5% base recognition from fund)
- BUT: To remain a member, donors must also build mutual recognition through relationship
- Prevents: Capital = permanent control
- Ensures: Funders stay connected to actual work and relationships

**Example:**
```
Foundation X contributes $100K
- Receives 15% base recognition from Trust
- Must build additional 15% through relationships to reach threshold
- If Foundation X disengages relationally, loses membership even with capital contribution
```

### 3.4 Communities & Bioregional Hubs

**USES: Membership Module (MRD) at collective level**

**Previous approach**: "Form local DAO, receive initiation ceremony, enter sacred agreement"
**New approach**: Collective membership through mutual recognition with other hubs/communities

```
Community Membership Works Like Individual Membership:

Each community/hub is treated as a participant:
- Other hubs/communities recognize their contributions
- Mutual recognition computed between hubs
- MRD determines if community is part of meta-trust network

Example:
Water Unity Network (Uganda hub) ↔ Aquiares (Costa Rica hub): 25% mutual
Water Unity Network ↔ Riverina (Australia hub): 18% mutual
Water Unity Network ↔ Planetary Party Protocol: 30% mutual

Water Unity Network MRS = 25% + 18% + 30% = 73%
If Network Average = 60%, MRD = 73% / 60% = 1.22 → Member hub
```

---

## 4. Resource Allocation & Financial Model

### 4.1 Collective Recognition for Resource Allocation

**USES: Collective Recognition Module**

**Previous approach**: "Returns flow as reciprocity to seed next bioregions" (mechanism unclear)
**New approach**: Computational resource allocation through collective recognition

#### How Resources Flow:

**Step 1: Needs Declaration**
```
Each member/community declares their needs:
- Alice (Water Unity): $50K for Uganda WCRC
- Bob (Aquiares): $75K for Costa Rica pilot infrastructure
- Charlie (Riverina): $150K for land acquisition
- Dave (Dream Tank): $30K for Haiti Water Design Challenge
```

**Step 2: Collective Capacity Declaration**
```
Each member declares what collective capacities they see:

Alice declares: 
  {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave} has "Water Infrastructure Capacity" 
  = $500K available this quarter

Bob declares:
  {Alice, Bob, Charlie} has "Regenerative Agriculture Capacity" 
  = $200K available this quarter

These are subjective views of what capacity the collective has.
```

**Step 3: Collective Recognition Share Calculation**
```
For Alice's declaration {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave}:

Mutual Recognition Pool:
- Alice ↔ Bob: 10%
- Alice ↔ Charlie: 8%
- Alice ↔ Dave: 12%
- Bob ↔ Charlie: 6%
- Bob ↔ Dave: 7%
- Charlie ↔ Dave: 9%
Total: 52%

Alice's Collective-Recognition-Share:
= (10% + 8% + 12%) / 52% = 57.7%

Alice's share of $500K water capacity: 
= 57.7% × $500K = $288.5K (held as visible claim)
```

**Step 4: Provider Response to Claims**
```
Alice has visible claim: $288.5K for Water Infrastructure

Providers (funders with actual capital) see Alice's claim and respond based on:
- Their mutual recognition with Alice
- Their assessment of claim legitimacy
- Their available capital

Foundation X (provider):
- Has $200K to allocate
- Mutual recognition with Alice: 15%
- Responds: $30K to Alice's claim

Individual Donor Y (provider):
- Has $10K to allocate
- Mutual recognition with Alice: 20%
- Responds: $8K to Alice's claim

Total fulfilled: $38K of Alice's $288.5K claim
```

#### What This Replaces:

**Original (Section 4.2):**
```
Seed Phase (2025): $1-2M per bioregional community
Wave 1 (2025-26): $100M+ for 30-50 community nodes
Wave 2 (2026-27): $1B+
Wave 3 (2027+): $10B-100B+
```

**Replaced with:**
```
NO FIXED PHASES OR AMOUNTS

Instead:
1. Members declare needs (continuously)
2. Members declare collective capacities (their view of what's available)
3. System computes collective-recognition-shares (visible claims)
4. Providers with actual capital respond to claims based on mutual recognition
5. Resources flow naturally to legitimate claims with strong recognition

Scale emerges organically from:
- Quality of recognition relationships
- Legitimacy of collective capacity declarations
- Provider confidence in claims
```

#### Why This is Better:

**Original problems:**
- Fixed phases require central planning
- $100M target is arbitrary
- "30-50 community nodes" requires selection committee
- Unclear who decides allocation

**Collective Recognition solutions:**
- ✓ No central planning needed
- ✓ No arbitrary targets
- ✓ No selection committee
- ✓ Allocation emerges from mutual recognition patterns
- ✓ Self-correcting (phantom claims get no provider response)
- ✓ Scales naturally with network growth

### 4.2 Reinvestment Spiral Using Collective Recognition

**Previous approach**: "Communities generate capital, returns forwarded as offerings to Trust"
**New approach**: Reciprocity encoded in recognition patterns

#### How It Works:

```
Year 1:
- Alice (Water Unity) receives $50K through collective recognition
- Water Unity generates $75K in value (measured by next cycle's recognition)

Year 2:
- Other members recognize Water Unity's increased contribution
- Alice's recognition from Bob increases: 10% → 15%
- Alice's recognition from Charlie increases: 8% → 12%
- Alice's recognition from Dave increases: 12% → 18%
- Alice's MutualRecognitionScore increases: 30% → 45%

Year 2 resource allocation:
- Alice's increased recognition → larger collective-recognition-share
- Alice's claim: $400K (up from $288.5K)
- More providers respond due to proven track record
- Fulfilled: $85K (up from $38K)

Reciprocity flows automatically through recognition increase.
```

**Success amplifies naturally:**
- Projects that deliver value get higher recognition
- Higher recognition → larger claims
- Larger claims attract more provider responses
- More resources flow to proven successes

**Failure corrects naturally:**
- Projects that fail lose recognition
- Lower recognition → smaller claims
- Smaller claims attract fewer provider responses
- Resources redirect to better performers

### 4.3 DreamTanking Integration

**Previous**: "Youth as co-architects of capital systems"
**Enhanced with Collective Recognition**:

```
Dream Tank creates collective capacity declarations for youth projects:

Dream Tank declares:
  {Youth Leader 1, Youth Leader 2, Youth Leader 3, ...} 
  has "Youth Innovation Capacity" = $100K/quarter

Each youth leader gets collective-recognition-share based on:
- Their mutual recognition within the youth collective
- Their mutual recognition with broader network members

Youth leaders hold visible claims:
- Leader 1: $25K claim (visible to provider network)
- Leader 2: $30K claim
- Leader 3: $20K claim

Providers respond based on:
- Mutual recognition with specific youth leaders
- Assessment of youth innovation legitimacy
- Available capital for youth innovation
```

**This enables**:
- Youth don't wait for approval
- Claims are visible to entire provider network
- Providers self-select which youth to support
- No committee deciding "which youth projects to fund"

---

## 5. Market of Sacred Reciprocity

### 5.1 Core Principles (Unchanged)
- Reciprocity over extraction
- Multi-dimensional value (financial, material, energetic, cultural, spiritual)
- Sovereignty of giver and receiver
- Visibility of intention
- Multi-layered currencies
- SoulTech integration

### 5.2 Market Functions Enhanced with Collective Recognition

**USES: Collective Recognition Module**

**Original market functions:**
- Offerings from communities
- Offerings from stewards
- Trust-based investment flows
- Shared tools & agreements
- Cultural trade & artifacts

**Enhanced mechanism:**

#### Example: Textile Trade

```
Anna (Riverina textiles) declares need:
- 1000 lbs wool processing capacity
- $20K for natural dye materials

Anna declares collective capacity:
  {Anna, Bob (Aquiares), Local Fiber Guild}
  has "Natural Textile Processing Capacity" 
  = 5000 lbs/month

Anna's collective-recognition-share: 45%
Anna's claim: 2250 lbs/month (visible to network)

Providers respond:
- Local Fiber Guild offers: 800 lbs processing
- Bob offers: Connection to Costa Rica natural dye suppliers
- Charlie offers: $5K toward dye materials

All based on mutual recognition with Anna and assessment of textile work legitimacy.
```

**What this replaces:**
- ❌ Unclear "how do offerings match with needs"
- ❌ "Trust-based investment flows via sacred agreement" (what does this mean operationally?)

**What this enables:**
- ✓ Clear matching mechanism (claims + provider responses)
- ✓ Visible needs and visible capacity
- ✓ Natural coordination without central planning

### 5.3 Ecological Trust Credits

**ENHANCED: Credits become collective capacity declarations**

**Original**: "Validated by community circles, held in DAO, convertible into NALU"
**Enhanced**: Credits are collective capacity declarations that attract provider responses

```
Water Unity (Uganda) validates work:
- 10 springs protected
- 50,000 gallons/day aquifer recharge

Water Unity declares collective capacity:
  {Water Unity, Local Water Council, Youth Leaders}
  has "Water Flow Credits" = 50,000 gallons/day capacity

Water Unity's collective-recognition-share: 60%
Water Unity's claim: 30,000 gallons/day credit claim (visible to network)

Providers respond:
- Carbon offset buyer: $15K for water credits
- Ecosystem service fund: $8K for aquifer recharge validation
- Local government: In-kind support for next phase

All based on mutual recognition and scientific validation of actual water restoration.
```

**Benefits:**
- Credits remain non-commodified (not sold like offsets)
- Credits create visible claims that attract aligned capital
- Validation through both science (data) and mutual recognition (relationships)
- Self-correcting (phantom credits get no provider response)

### 5.4 Dual Architecture: Outer/Inner Economy

**Outer Layer** (interfaces with traditional economy):
- Traditional currency transactions
- DAO contributions & investor inflows
- Tax-compliant flows
- Full transparency dashboards

**Inner Layer - NALU Economy**:

**ENHANCED: NALU as collective capacity currency**

```
NALU is earned through contributions that generate mutual recognition:
- Alice tends land → Bob recognizes 12% → Alice earns NALU proportional to recognition
- Recognition-based earnings create NALU balance

NALU spending creates collective capacity declarations:
- Alice spends 100 NALU on Bob's healing services
- This is a collective capacity declaration: {Alice, Bob} has "Healing Capacity"
- Both earn recognition from the transaction
- Mutual recognition increases

NALU becomes unit of account for collective recognition flows.
```

**Benefits:**
- NALU tied directly to mutual recognition (not speculative)
- NALU spending strengthens recognition networks
- NALU earning reflects recognized contributions
- Natural circulation within trust ecosystem

---

## 6. DAO Governance

### 6.1 Multi-Layered Structure

**USES: Membership Module + Decider (minimal)**

#### Outer DAO: Legal & Financial Governance

**Previous approach**: "Lead Trustees, Circle Keepers, Fund Stewards (roles)"
**New approach**: Membership-based participation, role-free

```
Outer DAO Participation:
- Determined by Trust Network Membership (MRD ≥ 0.5)
- No assigned roles
- Participation weighted by MRD score

Example:
Current members: {Alice (MRD: 1.2), Bob (MRD: 0.9), Charlie (MRD: 1.5)}

When Outer DAO needs to approve major legal decision:
- Use Decider for structured decision
- Support points weighted by MRD
- Alice's support points × 1.2
- Bob's support points × 0.9
- Charlie's support points × 1.5
```

**What this replaces:**
- ❌ "Lead Trustees" (who decides who is Lead Trustee?)
- ❌ "Circle Keepers" (who keeps the circles?)
- ❌ "Fund Stewards" (who appoints stewards?)

**What this enables:**
- ✓ Participation emerges from membership (MRD)
- ✓ Influence proportional to network integration
- ✓ No appointment or election needed
- ✓ Natural rotation (as MRD changes, participation changes)

#### Inner DAO: Resonance & Circle-Based Governance

**Previous approach**: "Council seats held by roles: Elders, Youth Voices, Seed Keepers"
**New approach**: Role recognition through mutual recognition tags

```
Recognition can be tagged with contribution type:
- "Alice: 15% (water stewardship work)"
- "Bob: 12% (youth mentorship work)"
- "Charlie: 18% (seed keeping work)"

System automatically identifies who is recognized for what:
- Water Tenders: Those primarily recognized for water work
- Seed Stewards: Those primarily recognized for seed work
- Youth Voices: Youth members (age flag) with high MRD

No appointment needed - roles emerge from recognition patterns.
```

**When Inner DAO needs decision:**
```
Topic: Water credit validation protocol for Uganda

System identifies relevant members:
- Those with high recognition in water stewardship
- Those from Uganda bioregion
- Those with relevant technical expertise (from recognition tags)

Decider process among relevant members:
1. Proposals from water stewards
2. Challenges from technical experts
3. Discussion including local community input
4. Improvements incorporating feedback
5. Support distribution (weighted by relevant recognition)

Decision emerges from those most qualified and connected.
```

#### Interstitial Membrane: DAO Connectors

**Previous**: "Ceremonial Translators" (who appoints them?)
**New**: Bridge roles emerge from dual high recognition

```
Connector = High MRD in BOTH Outer DAO AND specific Inner DAO

Example:
Alice has high recognition in:
- Outer DAO legal/financial work (30% MRS)
- Uganda bioregion water work (25% MRS)

Alice naturally functions as connector because:
- Trusted in both contexts
- Can translate between legal and local needs
- No appointment needed
```

### 6.2 Core DAO Tools

**USES: Decider (minimal)**

**Previous approach**: "Resonance Quorum: Decisions by attunement, not majority"
**New approach**: Use Decider for key decisions, weighted by recognition

```
Resonance Quorum Replacement:

When major decision needed:
1. Only members (MRD ≥ threshold) can participate
2. Use Decider process for structured deliberation
3. Support points weighted by:
   - Overall MRD (network integration)
   - Relevant recognition (for topic-specific decisions)
   
Example: Decision on Swiss Verein legal structure
Relevant members: Those with legal/financial recognition
Support points weighted by MRD

Result: Decision has genuine support from those most integrated and qualified
Not "attunement" (subjective) but computational (objective)
```

**When to use Decider (minimize usage):**
- Constitutional/structural decisions
- Major legal entity changes
- Network-wide policy setting
- Threshold parameter changes

**When NOT to use Decider:**
- Resource allocation (use Collective Recognition)
- Membership (use MRD Module)
- Daily operations (use Collective Recognition)
- Project decisions (use Collective Recognition)

### 6.3 DAO Ecological Stewardship

**Previous**: "Water Tender, Earth Witness Keeper, Seed Steward, etc. (appointed roles)"
**New**: Recognition-emergent specialization

```
Ecological Stewardship Through Recognition:

1. Initiating Ecological Agreements
   - Any member can propose (post to network)
   - Relevant members (high recognition in ecology) review
   - Collective Recognition determines resource allocation
   
2. Witnessing & Validating Credits
   - Scientific data collected
   - Members with relevant recognition validate
   - Validation = recognition boost for project
   - Invalid claims = recognition penalty
   
3. Recording Flows in Ledger
   - Automatic from Collective Recognition system
   - All flows visible to network
   - Tied to bioregion, action, lineage
   
4. Translating Credits into NALU
   - Validated credits increase collective capacity declarations
   - Higher declarations → larger claims
   - More provider responses → more NALU inflow
   
5. Amplifying through Trust Network
   - High recognition work automatically visible network-wide
   - Other nodes see successful patterns
   - Can replicate or support based on mutual recognition
```

**Roles emerge naturally:**
- Water Tender: Person with highest recognition for water stewardship
- Seed Steward: Person with highest recognition for biodiversity work
- Ledger Scribe: Person with highest recognition for data/documentation work

**No appointments, no rotations needed**:
- If current "Water Tender" stops contributing, recognition drops
- New person naturally emerges as most recognized for water work
- Smooth transition without governance decision

---

## 7. System Architecture

### 7.1 Three Layers

| Layer | Role | Free-Association Integration |
|-------|------|------------------------------|
| Trust Layer | Holds consent, stewardship, bioregional sovereignty | **Membership Module** determines consent |
| Market & Flow Layer | Tracks movement of resources, gifts, exchanges | **Collective Recognition** determines flows |
| Experience & Visibility Layer | Human interface: storytelling, dashboards, learning | Displays MRD scores, claims, recognitions |

### 7.2 Core Data Objects

**Enhanced with Free-Association data:**

- **Flow Records**: Now includes collective-recognition-shares and provider responses
  - Who gave (provider)
  - Who received (claimant)
  - Amount
  - Based on what mutual recognition
  - Responding to which collective capacity declaration

- **Soul Marks**: Now tied to recognition tags
  - "Alice: recognized for water stewardship"
  - "Bob: recognized for youth mentorship"
  - Non-transferable acknowledgments
  - Build recognition scores over time

- **Earth Anchors**: Now linked to ecological collective capacities
  - Place-based data (scientific)
  - Generates collective capacity declarations (ecological credits)
  - Attracts provider responses from aligned capital

### 7.3 Cycle of Reciprocity

**Enhanced with computational mechanisms:**

1. **Inspiration & Consent** → Member posts need/offering (visible to network)

2. **Resourcing & Movement** → 
   - Member declares collective capacity
   - System computes collective-recognition-share
   - Providers respond to claims
   - Creates Flow Records

3. **Action & Contribution** → 
   - Projects implemented
   - Contributors recognized by network
   - Recognition data accumulates

4. **Reflection & Visibility** → 
   - MRD scores update (weekly)
   - Collective Recognition recomputes (daily)
   - Outcomes visible in Experience Layer

5. **Reciprocity & Reinvestment** → 
   - Successful projects gain recognition
   - Higher recognition → larger future claims
   - Natural reciprocity spiral through recognition growth

### 7.4 Bioregional Dashboards

**Enhanced with real-time free-association data:**

Each bioregion dashboard shows:
- **Membership**: Current members, MRD scores, trajectories
- **Collective Capacities**: Active declarations and claims
- **Resource Flows**: Provider responses, fulfilled claims, pending needs
- **Recognition Patterns**: Who recognizes whom for what
- **Ecological Credits**: Validated work, collective capacity claims
- **Network Health**: Recognition density, membership growth, resource velocity

### 7.5 Lumina Interface

**Enhanced to display free-association mechanics:**

- **Public View**: Aggregated network patterns, success stories, active claims
- **Member View**: Personal MRD score, recognition breakdown, collective capacity declarations, provider responses
- **Provider View**: Active claims from network, filtered by mutual recognition, suggested responses
- **AI Guidance**: Pattern recognition, claim legitimacy assessment, suggested recognitions based on contributions

---

## 8. Meta-Trust Architecture

**USES: Membership Module at network level**

**Structure**: Fractal pattern of interconnected living trusts

**Each local trust:**
- Legally sovereign entity
- Has own membership (local MRD)
- Recognizes other trusts (inter-trust recognition)
- Part of meta-trust if meta-trust MRD ≥ threshold

**Meta-Trust Membership:**
```
Trust-level mutual recognition:

Water Unity Network ↔ Aquiares: 25%
Water Unity Network ↔ Riverina: 18%
Water Unity Network ↔ Planetary Party Protocol: 30%
Water Unity Network ↔ Dream Tank: 22%

Water Unity Network MRS = 95%
Meta-Trust Average MRS = 70%
Water Unity Network MRD = 95% / 70% = 1.36 → Meta-Trust Member

If Water Unity Network disengages, recognition drops, eventually loses meta-trust membership.
```

**What this replaces:**
- ❌ "Each local trust spiritually consecrated" (by whom?)
- ❌ "Bioregional frequency-holder" (who decides?)
- ❌ "Community-owned portal into regenerative economies" (who grants access?)

**What this enables:**
- ✓ Trust membership emerges from inter-trust recognition
- ✓ No central authority deciding which trusts belong
- ✓ Natural network growth and pruning
- ✓ Quality control through recognition patterns

**Functions enabled by network membership:**
- Access to collective capacity declarations across network
- Ability to see and respond to claims from other trusts
- Participation in meta-trust decisions (via Decider, weighted by MRD)
- Shared templates and tools
- Global commons access

---

## 9. Key Programs & Protocols

### 9.1-9.6 All Programs

**Each program becomes a member through MRD:**

```
Planetary Party Protocol (Juan Carlos Kaiten steward):
- Recognized by other trust members for festival/gathering work
- MRD score determines membership status
- Can make collective capacity declarations
- Can receive provider responses
- Influence proportional to recognition

Same for:
- Water Unity Network (Eliza Herald)
- Dream Tank (Heidi Cuppari)
- Living Trust Australia Textiles (Anna Crozier)
- Aquiares Pilot (Daniel Cunningham Jr)
- Riverina Land (Anna Crozier)
```

**Benefits:**
- No "appendix" hierarchy
- All programs equal, differentiated by recognition
- Programs rise/fall naturally based on contribution
- No approval needed to add new programs
- New programs join by building recognition

## Conclusion

This restructuring **removes all centralized governance** while **preserving all organizational structure**. 

**Every function** has a **computational mechanism**:
- Membership → MRD Module
- Resource allocation → Collective Recognition
- Major decisions → Decider (minimal)
- Role emergence → Recognition patterns
- Network health → Transparent metrics

**The result**: A truly decentralized living trust that operates through **recognition, not authority**.
