# Naluʻea Living Trust - Structural Overview

## 1. Core Concept

**Definition**: A meta-architecture (trust of trusts) for planetary bioregional development
- Decentralized network of legally sovereign, spiritually aligned trusts
- Each trust is rooted in a specific bioregion (ecological boundaries, not political)
- Bioregions defined by watersheds, river basins, aquifers, and natural boundaries

**Purpose**: Fund holistic community transformation through regenerative models

## 2. Trust Architecture

### 2.1 Horizontal Model: Community Transformation
- Based on Wheel of Co-Creation (12 domains)
- Domains: Land/Housing, Food, Water, Energy, Culture/Language, Health, Education, Economy, Governance
- Communities funded as complete ecosystems, not individual projects
- Returns flow as reciprocity (not debt) to seed next bioregions
- Guided by Planetary Party Protocol and Kuleana principles

### 2.2 Systemic Pathways (Verticals)
Each community activates across sectors:

1. **Clothing & Materials**: Regenerative supply chains, natural fibers, circular design, community cooperatives
2. **Healing & Health**: Ancestral medicine, trauma healing, medicinal plants, wellness centers
3. **Food & Water**: Agroecology, water stewardship, bioregional supply chains, seed libraries, rainwater harvesting
4. **Shelter & Sacred Space**: Natural building materials, community dwellings, regenerative architecture
5. **Education & Learning**: Land-based learning, elder-youth transmission, bioregional curriculum, guild apprenticeships
6. **Energy & Mobility**: Microgrids, renewable energy cooperatives, clean mobility, bioregional energy sovereignty
7. **Culture, Arts & Story**: Ancestral storytelling, bioregional arts, sacred media, youth-led culture creation

## 3. Participation Pathways

**Wave 1 (2025-26)**
- $100M+ for 30-50 community nodes

**Wave 2 (2026-27)**
- $1B+ into decentralized ecosystem
- Retirement funds, family offices, sovereign wealth participation

**Wave 3 (2027+)**
- $10B-100B+ through new market creation
- Investments backed by bioregional assets and regenerative revenue

### 4.3 DreamTanking Integration

## 5. Market of Sacred Reciprocity

### 5.1 Core Principles
- Reciprocity over extraction
- Multi-dimensional value (financial, material, energetic, cultural, spiritual)
- Sovereignty of giver and receiver
- Visibility of intention
- Multi-layered currencies (monetary, community points, trust credits, time offerings)
- SoulTech integration

### 5.2 Market Functions
- Offerings from communities (goods, services, crafts, teachings, ceremonies)
- Offerings from stewards (capital, expertise, technologies, legal tools)
- Trust-based investment flows
- Shared tools & agreements (DAO templates, cooperative contracts, IP protections)
- Cultural trade & artifacts
- Digital-physical bridge

### 5.3 Ecological Trust Credits
Types:
- Carbon Restoration Credits
- Biodiversity Credits
- Water Flow Credits
- Soil Healing Credits

Properties:
- Validated by community circles (science + story)
- Held in DAO (not sold for offset)
- Visible in Trust Ledger
- Convertible into NALU currency
- Offered to aligned investors

### 5.4 Dual Architecture

**Outer Layer**: Interfaces with existing economy
- Traditional currency transactions
- DAO contributions & investor inflows
- Tax-compliant flows
- Full transparency dashboards
- Visible to institutions and regulators

**Inner Layer**: NALU Economy (utility-based ecosystem)
- NALU units as trust-backed utility tokens (not speculative)
- Earned through contributions: tending land, teaching, creating, healing, mentoring
- Inter-bioregional use
- Trust-wide value library (community-determined exchange values)
- Transition bridge to reduce external currency dependence

## 6. DAO Governance

### 6.1 Multi-Layered Structure

**Outer DAO**: Legal & Financial Governance
- Anchored in Living Trust institutional instances (Swiss Verein, US Private Trust)
- Formal roles: Lead Trustees, Circle Keepers, Fund Stewards
- Approves large-scale flows, tax protocols, investment agreements
- Interoperable with external platforms
- Open-sourced templates

**Inner DAO**: Resonance & Circle-Based Governance
- Sovereign within each community/bioregion
- Uses SoulTech for identity, consent, alignment mapping
- Council seats held by roles: Elders, Youth Voices, Seed Keepers, Flame Carriers
- Integrates local traditions
- Community decisions ripple up through resonance

**Interstitial Membrane**: DAO Connectors
- Bridge roles hold both outer and inner keys
- Translate legal-financial needs into bioregional language
- Ensure outer funding aligns with inner values
- Ceremonial Translators role

### 6.2 Core DAO Tools
- **Resonance Quorum**: Decisions by attunement, not majority
- **Scroll of Continuance**: Living document of purpose, roles, agreements, rituals
- **Transparency Layer**: All flows, decisions, agreements visible
- **Succession & Inheritance Protocols**: Roles passed through ritual/mentorship

### 6.3 DAO Ecological Stewardship

**Responsibilities**:
1. Initiating Ecological Agreements (Scrolls of Stewardship)
2. Witnessing & Validating Credits (scientific data + ceremonial observation)
3. Recording Flows in Ledger (bioregion, action, lineage)
4. Translating Credits into NALU
5. Amplifying through Trust Network

**Roles**:

## 7. System Architecture

### 7.1 Three Layers

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| Trust Layer | Holds consent, stewardship, bioregional sovereignty. Ceremonial and legal. |
| Market & Flow Layer | Tracks movement of resources, gifts, exchanges between nodes. Transparent and dynamic. |
| Experience & Visibility Layer | Human interface: storytelling, dashboards, learning, AI guidance, public reflection. |

### 7.2 Core Data Objects

- **Flow Records**: Trace resource movement (who gave, who received, outcomes)
- **Soul Marks**: Non-transferable acknowledgments honoring authorship, learning, creativity, care
- **Earth Anchors**: Tie flows/marks to place; encode scientific and ceremonial data

### 7.3 Cycle of Reciprocity

1. Inspiration & Consent → Community initiates offering in Trust Layer
2. Resourcing & Movement → Financial/material flows activated, creating Flow Records
3. Action & Contribution → Projects implemented, data gathered locally
4. Reflection & Visibility → Outcomes surfaced in Experience Layer
5. Reciprocity & Reinvestment → Surpluses return to Spiral Fund

### 7.4 Bioregional Dashboards
Each bioregion has Living Dashboard integrating:
- Local ecosystem data (Earth Anchors)
- Community-defined wellbeing indicators
- Flow Records and financial transparency
- Soul Marks and story snapshots

Based on Planetary PPP's Ecosystem of Evolutionary Solutions
