# Collective Recognition

We use free-association to apportion and distribute collective-capacities such as the funds in the playnet open collective!

## How do we prioritize needs?

Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization
Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)

0\) Players define the collective as a set of members

* Playnet: { Alice, Bob, Charlie }

1\) Players submit their needs (via free-association interface)

* Alice: { needs $1000/month }
* Bob: { needs $500/month }
* Charlie: { needs $200/month }

2\) Players (via free-association interface) recognize the contributions of others towards the satisfaction of their needs/realization of their priorities (in the widest sense - as they define them)

* When players mutually-validate each others' contributions by recognizing eachother, they automatically apportion eachother a percentage % of their total-mutual-fulfillment&#x20;

3\) Derive **total-collective-mutual-fulfillment** by *adding up* all the **total-mutual-fulfillment** percentages across **all members of the collective**.

3\) Derive **each player's share of the total-collective-mutual-fulfillment.**

This is now the **collective-priority-distribution** of needs

We then take the needs of each member, and try to fulfill them as much as possible while respecting the collective-prioritization of needs

## Advantages

* **No centralized definition of what is a meaningful contribution**
* **Distributed determination of value**
* **No centralized registry of a capacities collective-membership**
* **No centralized registry of capacity availability space-time quantity**
* **Each player attributes their own membership-list to a their view of a collective-capacity and its availability  / space-time quantities (potentially subscribing to data sources to feed into their view) and use this information to navigate co-creation with others.**

## Remaining Issues to be Solved

* For Playnet Open Collective: What about people who are members but can not invoice themselves?
