# Decider

## What is Decider?

**Decider is a structured way for groups to make decisions together fairly.**

Think of it like a guided conversation where everyone gets a voice, concerns are heard, and the group finds the best solution together—not just the most popular one.

***

### Why Decider Exists

When groups try to make decisions, they often run into problems:

* **The loudest voice wins** instead of the best idea
* **Good ideas get shot down** before they're fully understood
* **People don't explain their concerns** clearly
* **Quick votes miss important details** that come up later
* **Someone has to be "in charge"** of running the process

Decider solves these by giving everyone a clear path to contribute, challenge, improve, and ultimately support the best options.

***

### The Complete Process

Let's walk through how three friends—**Alice, Bob, and Carol**—use Decider to figure out what to have for dinner.

#### **Step 1: Setting Up**

Alice wants to organize the decision. She:

1. Picks a question: "What should we have for dinner?"
2. Invites Bob and Carol to participate
3. Shares this information with everyone

Everyone agrees they're deciding together and can see who's involved.

**Why this matters:** Everyone knows what they're deciding and who's participating. No confusion about the goal.

***

#### **Step 2: Everyone Proposes Ideas**

Now each person shares their initial idea:

* **Alice suggests:** "Pizza"
* **Bob suggests:** "Sushi"
* **Carol suggests:** "Tacos"

Everyone can see all three ideas as they come in.

**Why this matters:** Getting all ideas on the table first, before any discussion or criticism, ensures no one holds back. Every voice is equal at this stage.

***

#### **Step 3: Raising Challenges**

Now people can raise concerns about any proposal. This isn't about attacking ideas—it's about surfacing important information.

* **Bob raises a concern about Alice's pizza:** "Pizza has gluten, and Carol is allergic to gluten."
* **Alice raises a concern about Bob's sushi:** "Sushi is really expensive, and we said we're on a budget this week."
* **No one raises concerns about Carol's tacos**

**Why this matters:** Often, the person suggesting an idea doesn't know about problems others can see. This phase brings important facts to light before anyone commits to a decision.

***

#### **Step 4: Discussion and Comments**

People now discuss the proposals and challenges to add context:

* **Carol comments on Bob's concern:** "Thanks Bob! I didn't know Alice forgot about my allergy. Good catch."
* **Alice adds to her concern about sushi:** "What if we bought grocery store sushi instead of going to a restaurant? That would be cheaper."
* **Carol comments on her own tacos:** "Just so everyone knows, my taco recipe is vegetarian and really budget-friendly."

**Why this matters:** Not every concern kills an idea. Discussion helps everyone understand the full picture and sometimes reveals simple solutions to problems.

***

#### **Step 5: Proposing Improvements**

Based on what they learned, people can suggest modified versions of the original ideas:

* **Alice modifies her pizza idea:** "Gluten-free pizza" (addresses Bob's concern)
* **Bob modifies his sushi idea:** "Grocery store sushi rolls" (addresses Alice's budget concern)
* **Carol doesn't modify her tacos** (no concerns were raised)

Now the group has more options to choose from:

* Pizza OR gluten-free pizza
* Sushi OR grocery store sushi rolls
* Tacos

**Why this matters:** This is where good ideas get better. Instead of just voting "yes/no" on original proposals, people can adapt ideas based on feedback. Collaboration improves outcomes.

***

#### **Step 6: Expressing Support**

Now comes the crucial part: **everyone distributes support points** across ALL the options.

This isn't simple voting. Each person gives more points to options they support more strongly.

**Alice's support:**

* Original pizza: 0 points
* Gluten-free pizza: 3 points
* Original sushi: 2 points
* Grocery store sushi: 5 points
* Tacos: 7 points

**Bob's support:**

* Original pizza: 0 points
* Gluten-free pizza: 4 points
* Original sushi: 1 point
* Grocery store sushi: 3 points
* Tacos: 8 points

**Carol's support:**

* Original pizza: 0 points
* Gluten-free pizza: 2 points
* Original sushi: 0 points
* Grocery store sushi: 4 points
* Tacos: 10 points

**Why this matters:** Point distribution reveals preference intensity. Carol really wants tacos (10 points!), while Bob moderately prefers the gluten-free pizza (4 points). This captures nuance that simple yes/no votes miss.

***

#### **Step 7: Finding the Winner**

Now Decider adds up all the points for each option:

**For Alice's original proposal (Pizza):**

* Original pizza: 0 total points
* Gluten-free pizza: 3 + 4 + 2 = **9 points** ← Winner

**For Bob's original proposal (Sushi):**

* Original sushi: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 points
* Grocery store sushi: 5 + 3 + 4 = **12 points** ← Winner

**For Carol's original proposal (Tacos):**

* Tacos: 7 + 8 + 10 = **25 points** ← Winner (and highest overall!)

**The group's final decision:** Tacos got the most support overall, so that's what they'll have for dinner.

**Why this matters:** The winning option has genuine group support, not just a bare majority. Everyone participated in shaping the outcome.

### How the Peer-to-Peer Part Works

Here's the clever part: **there's no central authority or server**.

Think of it like this:

**Traditional Group Decision (Centralized):**

* Everyone sends their ideas to one person (the organizer)
* That person collects everything
* That person shares it back with the group
* If the organizer disappears, everything is lost

**Decider Way (Peer-to-Peer):**

* Everyone keeps their own notes on their own device
* Everyone shares their notes directly with each other
* Everyone can see everyone else's notes in real-time
* No one is "in charge"—everyone has equal access to all information
* If one person disappears, everyone else still has all the information

It's like if you and your friends were all looking at the same whiteboard, but each person draws on their own section, and everyone can see the whole board automatically.

**Benefits:**

* **No single point of failure:** No one person controls everything
* **Transparent:** Everyone sees everything as it happens
* **Equal:** No hierarchy—everyone has the same power
* **Private:** Your personal data stays on your device, shared only with people you choose

### The Big Picture

Decider transforms how groups make decisions by:

1. **Giving structure to chaos:** Instead of endless discussion, there's a clear path forward
2. **Ensuring everyone is heard:** The phases guarantee every voice matters
3. **Encouraging improvement:** Ideas evolve rather than just win or lose
4. **Building consensus:** The result has genuine group support
5. **Removing gatekeepers:** No one person controls the process

**Without Decider:**

* Discussions go in circles
* Good ideas get dismissed too quickly
* Strong personalities dominate
* People feel unheard
* Decisions feel arbitrary

**With Decider:**

* Clear progression from ideas to decision
* Concerns are systematically addressed
* Everyone contributes equally
* Ideas improve through collaboration
* Decisions feel fair and well-considered

### Real-World Uses

**Small Groups:**

* Friends deciding where to travel
* Families planning meals or activities
* Roommates setting house rules

**Teams:**

* Which project to work on next
* How to approach a problem
* Setting team priorities

**Communities:**

* Deciding community guidelines
* Allocating shared resources
* Planning events

**Organizations:**

* Policy decisions
* Strategic planning
* Resource allocation

Anywhere a group needs to make a decision together, Decider provides a fair, structured way to do it.

### The Key Insight

**Decider isn't about voting—it's about collaboration.**

Traditional voting is binary: yes or no, winner or loser. It creates divisions.

Decider is about **iterative refinement**: propose, learn, improve, support. It creates alignment.

The best ideas aren't the ones people start with—they're the ones that emerge after everyone has contributed their knowledge, concerns, and creativity.

That's what Decider makes possible.
