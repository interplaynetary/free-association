# Protocol

## Free-Association Organizational Protocol

### Organization

Protocol operates through three computational mechanisms:

1. **Membership Module**: Determines who participates based on mutual recognition density
2. **Collective Recognition**: Allocates resources based on recognized needs and collective capacities
3. **Decider**: Structured decisions for threshold setting and parameter tuning

No governance. No committees. No appointments. Pure computation from recognition patterns.

***

### Core Principles

#### The 100% Recognition Constraint

**Each participant has exactly 100% recognition to distribute.**

This is not arbitrary - it represents a fundamental truth:

* Your self-actualization is a whole (100%)
* Everything that enables your self-actualization sums to that whole
* You cannot exceed 100% (you can't self-actualize more than fully)
* You cannot go below 100% (your self-actualization is complete as-is)

**What this means:**

```
When you give Bob 15% recognition, you're saying:
"Bob's contributions represent 15% of what enables me to self-actualize."

When you give Charlie 12% recognition, you're saying:
"Charlie's contributions represent 12% of what enables me to self-actualize."

Total distributed = 100% = your complete self-actualization
```

**Trade-offs are real:**

```
If you increase Bob from 15% → 20%, you must decrease others.

Why? Because if Bob truly represents more of what enables your self-actualization,
something else must represent less. Your total capacity to self-actualize hasn't changed.

This creates honest accounting:
- Forces you to acknowledge actual contribution proportions
- Prevents recognition inflation
- Makes recognition a real claim on what enables you
- Creates natural scarcity that reflects reality
```

**Dynamic adjustment:**

```
Your recognition distribution can change:

Month 1: Bob enables 15% of my self-actualization
Month 2: Bob's new water system enables 20% of my self-actualization
→ I adjust: Bob 15% → 20%, reduce others proportionally

This reflects changing reality of what enables me.
```

**Non-transferable:**

```
Recognition cannot be sold, traded, or transferred.

Why? Because it represents YOUR view of what enables YOUR self-actualization.
Only you can determine what enables you to self-actualize.
No one else can speak for your self-actualization.

This prevents:
- Markets in recognition (would corrupt meaning)
- Capture by those with capital
- Recognition as speculation
- Disconnection from actual enabling contributions
```

***

### 1. Membership: Who Participates

#### Recognition as Fundamental Unit

**Recognition is your acknowledgment of contributions toward your own self-actualization.**

Each participant has 100% total recognition to distribute:

* Represents what enables you to self-actualize
* Includes direct contributions to your work/life
* Includes contributions to social values and needs you care about
* Non-transferable (cannot be sold or traded)
* Dynamically adjustable as relationships and contributions evolve

```
Alice's total recognition = 100%
Alice distributes:
- Bob: 15% (Bob's work on water infrastructure enables my agricultural work)
- Charlie: 12% (Charlie's documentation helps me communicate our impact)
- Dave: 8% (Dave's technical systems support my projects)
- Eve: 10% (Eve's community organizing creates conditions I need)
- Others: 55% (distributed among other contributors)

Constraint: Σ Alice's recognitions = 100%
```

**Mutual Recognition = minimum of bidirectional recognitions**

```
Alice recognizes Bob: 15% (of Alice's self-actualization)
Bob recognizes Alice: 12% (of Bob's self-actualization)

→ Mutual Recognition: min(15%, 12%) = 12%
```

**Why the minimum?**

* Ensures reciprocity in proportion
* One-sided recognition doesn't create mutual relationship
* Both must acknowledge the other's contribution to their own self-actualization
* Creates genuine mutual interdependence, not patronage

**Example:**

```
If Bob is 50% of Alice's self-actualization (Alice deeply depends on Bob)
But Alice is only 10% of Bob's self-actualization (Bob benefits less from Alice)
→ Mutual recognition = 10%

This captures the reality: their mutual interdependence is limited by the weaker direction.
Alice may depend on Bob more, but their actual mutual relationship is 10%.
```

#### Membership Computation

**Mutual Recognition Score (MRS)**:

```
MRS(Alice) = Σ MutualRecognition(Alice, Member) for all current members
```

**Network Average**:

```
AverageMRS = Σ MRS(Member) / Count(Members)
```

**Mutual Recognition Density (MRD)**:

```
MRD(Alice) = MRS(Alice) / AverageMRS
```

**Membership Status**:

```
IsMember(Alice) = MRD(Alice) ≥ threshold

Default threshold: 0.5
Computed: Weekly
```

#### Properties

* No gatekeeping: Membership emerges from mutual recognition
* No appointments: MRD computation is automatic
* Self-correcting: Stop contributing → recognition drops → lose membership
* Sybil-resistant: Fake accounts can't build genuine mutual recognition
* Scale-invariant: Threshold adjusts automatically as network grows

#### Example

```
Week 0: Bootstrap
Seed participants: {Alice, Bob, Charlie}
Initial recognition creates baseline MRD ≈ 1.0 for all

Week 4: Dave joins
Dave builds relationships:
- Dave ↔ Alice: 10% mutual
- Dave ↔ Bob: 6% mutual  
- Dave ↔ Charlie: 0% mutual

Dave's MRS = 16%
Network Average = 42%
Dave's MRD = 16% / 42% = 0.38

0.38 < 0.5 → Dave not yet a member

Week 8: Dave deepens integration
- Dave ↔ Alice: 14% mutual
- Dave ↔ Bob: 9% mutual
- Dave ↔ Charlie: 7% mutual

Dave's MRS = 30%
Network Average = 46.67%
Dave's MRD = 30% / 46.67% = 0.64

0.64 ≥ 0.5 → Dave becomes a member
```

***

### 2. Resource Allocation: Who Gets What

#### Recognition and Self-Actualization

**Core Principle:** You recognize contributions that enable your self-actualization.

When you recognize someone:

* You acknowledge they contribute to your ability to self-actualize
* This could be direct (they help your work)
* Or indirect (they contribute to social values/conditions you need)

**Examples:**

```
Alice recognizes Bob: 15%
Meaning: "Bob's water infrastructure work is 15% of what enables me to self-actualize.
It creates conditions for my agricultural work, supports communities I care about,
and advances values that matter to my ability to live meaningfully."

Bob recognizes Alice: 12%  
Meaning: "Alice's agricultural innovation is 12% of what enables me to self-actualize.
Her work validates and extends my water systems, creates real-world impact,
and demonstrates the regenerative values I work to advance."
```

**Recognition flows naturally toward enabling contributions:**

* Those who enable many people's self-actualization receive high aggregate recognition
* Those who enable few people's self-actualization receive low aggregate recognition
* Quality and breadth of enabling contribution determines recognition

#### Needs and Capacities

**Need Declaration**:

```
Any participant can declare a need for their self-actualization:
- Alice: "I need $50,000 for water filtration systems in Uganda"
- Bob: "I need 200 hours of web development work"
- Charlie: "I need 5 acres of land for regenerative agriculture pilot"

These are what they need to actualize their contributions.
All needs are visible in the network.
```

**Provider Capacity Declaration**:

```
Only providers (those with actual resources) declare capacities:

Foundation X declares:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}
  Capacity-Type: "Water Infrastructure Funding"
  Total-Amount: $200,000

Interpretation: "I (Foundation X) can provide $200K to support water infrastructure
work among these participants. I recognize this group's collective capacity to
use these resources effectively toward water infrastructure."
```

**Why only providers declare capacities:**

* Providers know what they can actually provide (eliminates phantom capacity)
* Non-providers speculating about capacity adds no value
* Providers evaluate needs directly through their own capacity lens
* Eliminates intermediate "claim" concept

#### Collective Recognition Allocation

When Foundation X declares a capacity for {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}:

**Step 1: Calculate Collective Recognition Pool**

```
Pool = Σ MutualRecognition(i, j) for all pairs in provider's set

Example:
Alice ↔ Bob: 10%
Alice ↔ Charlie: 8%
Alice ↔ Dave: 12%
Alice ↔ Eve: 9%
Bob ↔ Charlie: 6%
Bob ↔ Dave: 7%
Bob ↔ Eve: 5%
Charlie ↔ Dave: 9%
Charlie ↔ Eve: 7%
Dave ↔ Eve: 8%

Pool = 81%
```

**Step 2: Calculate Each Person's Collective Recognition Share**

```
Alice's-Share = (Σ MutualRecognition(Alice, Others-in-set)) / Pool
                = (10% + 8% + 12% + 9%) / 81%
                = 48.1%

Bob's-Share = (10% + 6% + 7% + 5%) / 81% = 34.6%
Charlie's-Share = (8% + 6% + 9% + 7%) / 81% = 37.0%
Dave's-Share = (12% + 7% + 9% + 8%) / 81% = 44.4%
Eve's-Share = (9% + 5% + 7% + 8%) / 81% = 35.8%
```

**Step 3: Provider Sees Needs and Allocates**

```
Foundation X sees needs from members of their declared set:
- Alice needs: $50K (water filtration)
- Bob needs: $30K (pump systems)
- Charlie needs: $25K (sanitation)
- Dave needs: $40K (infrastructure)
- Eve needs: $15K (education)

Foundation X has $200K to allocate.

Foundation X allocates based on:
1. Collective recognition shares (who's most mutually recognized in the set)
2. Expressed needs (what people actually need)
3. Foundation's own recognition of each person (who enables Foundation's self-actualization)
4. Available capacity ($200K total)

Foundation X allocation:
- Alice: $50K (high collective recognition, full need met)
- Dave: $40K (high collective recognition, full need met)
- Bob: $30K (medium collective recognition, full need met)
- Charlie: $25K (medium collective recognition, full need met)
- Eve: $15K (lower collective recognition, but all needs in set were met)
- Total: $160K allocated, $40K remaining for future needs

All needs in this set were fully met because total needs ($160K) < capacity ($200K).
```

**Allocation when capacity is constrained:**

```
If Foundation X only had $100K:

Allocation would prioritize by collective recognition shares:
- Alice: $50K (48.1% × need fully met, highest recognition)
- Dave: $35K (44.4% × need partially met, second highest recognition)
- Bob: $15K (34.6% × need partially met)
- Total: $100K allocated

Remaining unfulfilled needs visible to other providers.
```

**Key insight:**

* Providers aren't "donating" - they're investing in what enables their own self-actualization
* Collective recognition shares guide allocation priorities
* Providers see actual needs and allocate based on their available resources
* No intermediate "claims" needed - direct from capacity to allocation

#### Self-Correction Mechanisms

**Phantom Capacity Eliminated**:

```
Unlike the old model where anyone could declare phantom capacity,
only providers (with actual resources) declare capacity.

Foundation X declares: $200K capacity for {Alice, Bob, Charlie}
→ Foundation X has $200K and is committing to allocate it
→ No phantom capacity possible (provider wouldn't declare what they don't have)
```

**Success Amplifies**:

```
Cycle 1:
Foundation X allocates $50K to Alice, Alice delivers water filtration systems

Cycle 2:
Other members increase recognition of Alice:
- Bob: 10% → 15%
- Charlie: 8% → 12%
- Dave: 12% → 18%

Alice's MRS increases: 30% → 45%

Cycle 3:
Foundation Y declares capacity including Alice
Alice's collective-recognition-share is now higher due to increased recognition
Foundation Y allocates more to Alice based on higher recognition
Alice receives $85K
```

**Failure Corrects**:

```
If Alice fails to deliver:
- Recognition from Bob, Charlie, Dave decreases
- Alice's MRS drops
- Alice's collective-recognition-share shrinks in future capacity sets
- Providers allocate less to Alice (lower recognition)
- Resources naturally redirect to better performers
```

#### Multiple Provider Lenses

```
Foundation X declares:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Charlie}
  Capacity: $300K for "Water Infrastructure"
  
Foundation Y declares:
  Set: {Alice, Dave, Eve}
  Capacity: 500 hours for "Education Programs"
  
Individual Donor Z declares:
  Set: {Bob, Charlie, Alice}
  Capacity: $50K for "Community Organizing"

Each provider sees needs through their own lens.
Each provider allocates based on collective recognition within their set.
Alice can receive from multiple providers based on different capacity sets.
```

#### Primary Model: Administrative Entity as Computational Provider

**This is the core model. The administrative entity holds funds and allocates computationally.**

```
Administrative entity has $100K available balance (from general donations, accumulated surplus, etc.)

Automatic Allocation Protocol:
1. Available balance becomes declared capacity
2. Capacity set = all current members (MRD ≥ threshold)
3. Protocol computes collective-recognition-shares for all members
4. Protocol reviews all open needs from members
5. Protocol allocates automatically based on:
   - Collective-recognition-share (higher share = higher priority)
   - Need amount and urgency
   - Available capacity
   - Compliance filters (see below)
6. Admins receive transfer instructions
7. Admins execute mechanically

Example:
Administrative entity balance: $100K
Members: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}

Collective-recognition-shares:
- Alice: 28% (highest mutual recognition)
- Bob: 22%
- Charlie: 19%
- Dave: 18%
- Eve: 13%

Open needs:
- Alice: $50K (water infrastructure)
- Bob: $30K (agriculture)
- Charlie: $25K (education)
- Dave: $20K (research)
- Eve: $15K (organizing)

Protocol allocation (prioritized by recognition + feasibility):
- Alice: $50K (highest share, full need met)
- Bob: $30K (second priority, full need met)
- Charlie: $20K (partial, capacity exhausted)
- Total: $100K allocated

Admins receive: "Transfer $50K to Alice, $30K to Bob, $20K to Charlie"
Admins execute transfers.
```

**Key principle:** The admins don't decide allocations. The protocol computes allocations based on collective recognition + needs + compliance filters.

#### Secondary Model: External Provider via Administrative Entity

**External providers can use the administrative entity as an execution agent for their allocations.**

```
Foundation X deposits $100K to administrative entity:
- Foundation X declares capacity and specifies member set
- Foundation X reviews collective-recognition-shares within their set
- Foundation X makes allocation decisions
- Foundation X instructs admins to execute
- Admins execute Foundation X's allocation decisions mechanically
- Provider: Foundation X (makes decisions, uses administrative entity for execution)
```

#### Capacity Filters: Compliance and Restrictions

**Providers are wholly responsible for implementing filters to comply with socio-technical-legal limits.**

Each provider can apply filters to their capacity based on:

* AML/KYC compliance (Know Your Customer verification)
* Sanctions screening (OFAC, UN sanctions lists)
* Legal jurisdiction restrictions
* Tax compliance requirements
* Mission/purpose alignment
* Risk assessment

**Allocation Filter Model:**

```
Filter(Member, Capacity) = Maximum amount that can be allocated to Member from this Capacity

Values:
- $0 = Cannot allocate (sanctions, KYC failed, etc.)
- $X = Can allocate up to $X (jurisdiction limits, risk caps, etc.)
- Unlimited = No restriction

Allocation computation:
For each member:
  Ideal-Allocation = Collective-Recognition-Share × Total-Capacity
  Actual-Allocation = min(Ideal-Allocation, Filter(Member, Capacity), Member-Need)

Members who hit their filter limit receive up to that limit.
Remaining capacity redistributes to other members proportionally by their recognition shares.
```

**Example: Compliance Filtering with Limits**

```
Administrative entity has $100K to allocate
All members: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}

General collective-recognition-shares:
- Alice: 28%
- Bob: 22%
- Charlie: 19%
- Dave: 18%
- Eve: 13%

Entity's compliance filters:
- Alice: Unlimited (KYC complete, no restrictions)
- Bob: Unlimited (KYC complete, no restrictions)
- Charlie: $0 (KYC failed - cannot allocate)
- Dave: Unlimited (KYC complete, no restrictions)
- Eve: $5K max (Jurisdiction limit - can only send up to $5K to her country)

Open needs:
- Alice: $50K
- Bob: $30K
- Charlie: $25K
- Dave: $20K
- Eve: $15K

Initial allocation (by recognition share):
- Alice: 28% × $100K = $28K
- Bob: 22% × $100K = $22K
- Charlie: 19% × $100K = $19K
- Dave: 18% × $100K = $18K
- Eve: 13% × $100K = $13K

After applying filters:
- Alice: min($28K, Unlimited, $50K) = $28K ✓
- Bob: min($22K, Unlimited, $30K) = $22K ✓
- Charlie: min($19K, $0, $25K) = $0 ✗ (excluded by compliance)
- Dave: min($18K, Unlimited, $20K) = $18K ✓
- Eve: min($13K, $5K, $15K) = $5K ✓ (limited by filter)

Unallocated: $19K (Charlie) + $8K (Eve) = $27K

Redistribute $27K to remaining members by recognition share:
- Alice gets: 28/(28+22+18) × $27K = $11.1K → Total: $39.1K
- Bob gets: 22/(28+22+18) × $27K = $8.7K → Total: $30.7K (but need is $30K) → $30K
- Dave gets: 18/(28+22+18) × $27K = $7.1K → Total: $25.1K (but need is $20K) → $20K
- Excess: $0.1K + $5.1K = $5.2K → back to Alice

Final allocations:
- Alice: $39.1K + $5.2K = $44.3K (highest recognition, absorbs excess)
- Bob: $30K (full need met)
- Charlie: $0 (excluded by compliance filter)
- Dave: $20K (full need met)
- Eve: $5K (limited by jurisdiction filter, partial need met)
- Total: $99.3K allocated, $0.7K remains for next cycle
```

**Union of Filters (External Provider via Administrative Entity):**

```
When external provider uses administrative entity as executor, BOTH filters apply:

Effective-Filter(Member, Capacity) = min(
  Provider-Filter(Member, Capacity),
  Entity-Filter(Member, Capacity)
)

Most restrictive filter wins. Both must allow allocation.

Example:
Foundation X wants to allocate via administrative entity to Alice:
- Foundation X filter: $50K max (their internal risk limit)
- Entity filter: $30K max (jurisdiction limit for Alice's country)
- Effective filter: min($50K, $30K) = $30K

Foundation X wants to allocate via administrative entity to Charlie:
- Foundation X filter: $40K max (they approve Charlie)
- Entity filter: $0 (Charlie is on sanctions list)
- Effective filter: min($40K, $0) = $0 → Cannot allocate

Key: External provider's approval is necessary but not sufficient.
Administrative entity's compliance filters always apply.
```

**Compliance Responsibility:**

```
Each provider implements their own filters:

Administrative Entity (as provider):
- Must comply with applicable AML/KYC laws (jurisdiction-specific)
- Must screen against sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, EU)
- Must verify recipient identity (KYC)
- Sets Filter(Member, Capacity) for each member:
  - $0 for sanctioned individuals
  - $0 for KYC failures
  - $X for jurisdiction limits
  - Unlimited for fully compliant members
- Admins cannot override compliance filters

External Provider (via Administrative Entity):
- Responsible for their own compliance
- Sets their own Filter(Member, Capacity)
- Can be more restrictive than entity
- Cannot be less restrictive (entity filters always apply)
- Must instruct admins only on compliant transfers
- Example Foundation X filters:
  - $0 for members outside target countries
  - $0 for non-water projects (mission alignment)
  - $25K max per member (risk management)

Final allocation = min(Provider-Filter, Entity-Filter, Recognition-Share, Need)

Key principle: Providers own their compliance obligations.
Protocol provides filtering mechanism.
Union of filters ensures maximum compliance.
Admins execute only compliant, filtered allocations.
```

### 3. Decision Making: Setting Parameters

#### When to Use Decider

**Rarely. Only for:**

* Setting membership threshold (default 0.5)
* Setting minimum recognition level (default 0%)
* Setting computation frequency (default weekly)
* Constitutional/structural changes

**Not for:**

* Resource allocation (use Collective Recognition)
* Membership decisions (use MRD computation)
* Daily operations (use Collective Recognition)
* Project priorities (use Collective Recognition)

#### Decider Process

**Participants**: Only current members (MRD ≥ threshold)

**Weighted by Recognition**: Support points × MRD score

**Example: Setting Membership Threshold**

```
Current threshold: 0.5
Question: "Should we adjust the membership threshold?"

Step 1: Proposals
- Alice proposes: Keep at 0.5
- Bob proposes: Lower to 0.4 (more inclusive)
- Charlie proposes: Raise to 0.6 (more exclusive)

Step 2: Challenges
- Dave challenges Bob's 0.4: "We've had quality issues with barely-integrated members"
- Eve challenges Charlie's 0.6: "This would exclude valuable contributors still building relationships"
- No challenges to Alice's 0.5

Step 3: Discussion
- Bob responds: "What if 0.4 but with 6-month probation period?"
- Charlie responds: "What if 0.6 but only for resource allocation, not participation?"

Step 4: Improvements
- Bob modifies: "0.4 threshold with 1% minimum recognition filter"
- Charlie modifies: "0.5 for participation, 0.6 for resource allocation decisions"
- Alice keeps: "0.5 unchanged"

Step 5: Support Distribution
Each member distributes support points across all options:

Alice (MRD: 1.2):
- Keep 0.5: 10 points × 1.2 = 12 weighted points
- 0.4 with filter: 3 points × 1.2 = 3.6 weighted points
- 0.5/0.6 split: 5 points × 1.2 = 6 weighted points

Bob (MRD: 0.9):
- Keep 0.5: 4 points × 0.9 = 3.6 weighted points
- 0.4 with filter: 8 points × 0.9 = 7.2 weighted points
- 0.5/0.6 split: 2 points × 0.9 = 1.8 weighted points

Charlie (MRD: 1.5):
- Keep 0.5: 6 points × 1.5 = 9 weighted points
- 0.4 with filter: 1 point × 1.5 = 1.5 weighted points
- 0.5/0.6 split: 7 points × 1.5 = 10.5 weighted points

...continue for all members...

Step 6: Result
Winning option: Highest total weighted support
Decision takes effect next computation cycle
```

#### Decider Properties

* Structured: Clear phases prevent chaos
* Weighted: More integrated members have more influence
* Collaborative: Ideas improve through challenges and discussion
* Transparent: All proposals, challenges, support visible
* Fair: Everyone can propose, challenge, support

***

### 4. Complete System in Action

#### Scenario: Bioregional Water Trust

**Week 0: Bootstrap**

```
5 seed participants gather for first dialogue:
{Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}

They recognize each other's initial contributions:
Average mutual recognition: ~15% per pair

All start with MRD ≈ 1.0
All become initial members
```

**Week 1: First Resource Allocation**

```
Alice declares need:
"I need $50K to establish water filtration in Uganda village"

Foundation X declares capacity:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}
  Capacity-Type: "Water Infrastructure Funding"
  Total-Amount: $200K

Foundation X calculates collective recognition shares:
- Alice: 45% (highest mutual recognition in set)
- Bob: 28%
- Charlie: 22%
- Dave: 18%
- Eve: 15%

Foundation X sees Alice's $50K need (within their declared set)
Foundation X allocates: $25K to Alice (prioritized by recognition + need)

Individual Donor Y declares capacity:
  Set: {Alice, Bob}
  Capacity: $10K for water work
  
Donor Y allocates: $8K to Alice, $2K to Bob

Alice receives $33K of requested $50K
```

**Week 4: New Member Integration**

```
Frank wants to join
Frank contributes water engineering expertise

Recognition builds:
Week 1: Frank's MRD = 0.15 (not member)
Week 2: Frank's MRD = 0.28 (not member)
Week 3: Frank's MRD = 0.43 (not member)
Week 4: Frank's MRD = 0.52 (becomes member!)

No approval process needed - computation determines membership
```

**Week 8: Multiple Provider Lenses**

```
Multiple providers declare capacities through different lenses:

Foundation X declares:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Frank}
  Capacity: $100K for "Uganda Water Projects"

Foundation Y declares:
  Set: {Charlie, Dave, Eve}
  Capacity: $75K for "Kenya Sanitation"

Foundation Z declares:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve, Frank}
  Capacity: $500K for "Network Water Infrastructure"

Each provider:
- Calculates collective recognition shares within their set
- Sees needs from members of their set
- Allocates based on recognition + needs + available resources

Needs are visible to all providers.
Each provider allocates through their own capacity lens.
```

**Month 6: Success Amplification**

```
Alice successfully deployed Uganda water system
Recognition increases:
- Bob: 12% → 20%
- Frank: 8% → 15%
- Charlie: 10% → 12%

Alice's MRS: 30% → 47%
Alice's MRD: 0.7 → 1.1

Next cycle:
Foundation X declares new capacity including Alice
Alice's collective-recognition-share is higher (due to increased recognition)
Foundation X allocates $80K to Alice for expansion project

Automatic reciprocity through recognition growth.
```

**Month 12: Parameter Tuning**

```
Network has grown to 30 members
Some members suggest lowering threshold to 0.4

Decider process initiated:
- All members can propose threshold values
- Challenges raised about inclusion vs. quality
- Discussion surfaces concerns and possibilities
- Modified proposals incorporate feedback
- Support distributed (weighted by MRD)
- Decision: Keep 0.5 but add 1% minimum recognition filter

Implementation: Next computation cycle
```

**Year 2: Network Scaling**

```
Network now has 150 members across 5 bioregions

Providers declare capacities spanning geographies:
- Foundation X declares: $500K capacity for Uganda hub members
- Foundation Y declares: $300K capacity for Kenya hub members
- Foundation Z declares: $200K capacity for Rwanda hub members

Inter-hub recognition creates network effects:
- Uganda-Kenya mutual recognition: 25%
- Kenya-Rwanda mutual recognition: 18%
- Providers can declare cross-hub capacity sets

Large Foundation W declares:
  Set: {50 members across all hubs}
  Capacity: $2M for bioregional water infrastructure
  
Foundation W allocates based on collective recognition across entire network.

Meanwhile, administrative entity has accumulated $250K in unrestricted funds:
- Protocol automatically declares capacity: all 150 members
- Protocol computes collective-recognition-shares across entire network
- Protocol allocates $250K based on recognition + open needs
- Admins execute automatic allocations

No central coordination needed.
Resources flow based on provider capacity declarations + collective recognition.
```

### 5. Properties of This System

#### Philosophical Foundation

**This is not charity or altruism - it's mutual self-actualization.**

Traditional model:

* "Donors" give to "beneficiaries"
* Donor sacrifices for recipient's benefit
* Creates power dynamic (giver/receiver)
* Recipient feels dependent or grateful
* Giver feels benevolent or superior

Free-association model:

* Everyone invests in their own self-actualization
* Alice enables Bob's self-actualization; Bob enables Alice's self-actualization
* Both recognize what enables them
* Resources flow based on mutual recognition
* No giver/receiver dynamic - mutual enabling relationship

**Example:**

```
Foundation X doesn't "donate" to Alice's water project.
Foundation X recognizes: "Alice's water work is 15% of what enables us to self-actualize
(fulfill our mission, create meaningful impact, advance the values we exist to serve)."

Foundation X allocates to Alice's need because funding Alice IS Foundation X's self-actualization.

Alice isn't a "beneficiary" - Alice is what enables Foundation X to be what it wants to be.
```

**This transforms the entire dynamic:**

* Resources flow to what enables self-actualization (not to who can write best grant)
* Recognition measures actual enabling contribution (not performance for funders)
* Success = enabling more self-actualization across network (not extracting more funding)
* Everyone is both enabling and enabled (not givers vs. receivers)

#### What It Eliminates

* ❌ Membership approval processes
* ❌ Resource allocation committees
* ❌ Grant application reviews
* ❌ Appointed roles or positions
* ❌ Governance meetings (except rare Decider for parameters)
* ❌ Arbitrary funding targets
* ❌ Selection of beneficiaries
* ❌ Centralized planning
* ❌ Giver/receiver power dynamics
* ❌ Charitable dependency relationships
* ❌ Performance theater for funders
* ❌ Intermediate "claim" concept (providers allocate directly to needs)
* ❌ Admin discretion over entity funds (automatic computational allocation)

#### What It Guarantees

* ✓ Membership emerges from contribution and recognition
* ✓ Resources flow to recognized needs from willing providers
* ✓ Success amplifies through recognition increase
* ✓ Failure corrects through recognition decrease
* ✓ Only providers with actual resources declare capacity
* ✓ No single point of failure
* ✓ Transparent and auditable
* ✓ Scale-invariant (works from 5 to 5000 participants)
* ✓ Sybil-resistant
* ✓ Self-organizing around real contribution
* ✓ Direct allocation from capacity to needs (no intermediate claims)
* ✓ Entity's own funds allocated computationally (admins never decide)

#### Emergence Without Central Control

**Roles emerge naturally:**

```
System tracks recognition by type:
- Alice: 45% MRS (30% for water stewardship, 15% for community organizing)
- Bob: 38% MRS (25% for technical systems, 13% for documentation)

Dashboard shows:
- "Water Stewardship": Alice most recognized
- "Technical Systems": Bob most recognized

No appointments needed. Roles visible from recognition patterns.
```

**Priorities emerge naturally:**

```
Needs with high collective-recognition-shares in provider capacity sets = high priority
Needs that receive allocations from multiple providers = high priority
Needs with low collective-recognition-shares = low priority
Needs that receive no provider allocations = low priority

Priorities emerge from recognition + provider allocation patterns.
No planning committee needed.
```

**Quality emerges naturally:**

```
High quality work → high recognition → higher collective-recognition-shares → more provider allocations
Low quality work → low recognition → lower collective-recognition-shares → fewer provider allocations

Quality differential emerges automatically.
No quality review board needed.
```

type Recognition = {
  fromId: string;
  toId: string;
  percentage: number; // 0-100

};
```

  timestamp: Date;
  status: "open" | "partially-fulfilled" | "fulfilled";
};
```

#### Provider Capacity Declaration

    winningProposalId: string;
    totalWeightedSupport: number;
    breakdown: Record<string, number>; // proposalId → weighted support
  };
};
```

***

### 7. Computation Cycles

#### Weekly: Membership

```
Every Monday 00:00 UTC:

1. Collect all recognition data from past week
2. Calculate mutual recognitions for all pairs
3. Calculate MRS for all participants
4. Calculate network average MRS (from current members)
5. Calculate MRD for all participants
6. Update membership status
7. If membership changed, iterate once more for precision
8. Publish results to network
```

#### Daily: Resource Allocation

```
Every day 00:00 UTC:

1. Collect new need declarations
2. Collect new provider capacity declarations
3. Check Verein available balance (unrestricted funds):
   - If balance > 0, automatically generate capacity declaration:
     - Provider: "VEREIN_AUTOMATIC"
     - Set: all current members (MRD ≥ threshold)
     - Amount: available balance
     - isAutomatic: true
4. For each provider capacity (including automatic):
   - Calculate collective-recognition-shares within declared set
   - Match needs from members in the set
   - Provider/Protocol allocates based on recognition + needs + available capacity
5. Record allocations
6. Update need fulfillment status
7. Update recognition based on outcomes (successful delivery → recognition boost)
8. Publish results to network
```

#### As-Needed: Decider

```
When parameter change proposed:

1. Member initiates Decider session
2. Proposal phase (1 week)
3. Challenge phase (1 week)
4. Discussion phase (1 week)
5. Improvement phase (1 week)
6. Support phase (1 week)
7. Compute weighted result
8. Implement decision next cycle
```

### 9. Edge Cases

#### What if someone tries to declare capacity they don't have?

```
This edge case is eliminated by design:
- Only providers can declare capacity
- A provider declaring "$10 million capacity" commits to allocating that amount
- If provider doesn't actually have $10M, they won't declare it (would expose their fraud)
- No incentive to declare phantom capacity (you can only allocate what you have)

In the old model, non-providers could speculate about capacity.
In the new model, only providers with actual resources declare capacity.

Phantom capacity problem: Solved by eliminating non-provider capacity declarations.
```

#### What if everyone recognizes everyone maximally?

```
Everyone genuinely recognizes everyone at ~10% (equal distribution)

Result:
- Everyone has similar MRS (around 90% if 10 people)
- Everyone has MRD ≈ 1.0
- Everyone is a member

This is fine! If recognition is genuine and everyone contributes value, everyone should be a member.

If recognition is NOT genuine (just courtesy):
- Collective-recognition-shares will be relatively equal
- Providers will still allocate based on needs + their own judgment
- Providers can weight by their own recognition of recipients
- If outcomes are poor, providers reduce future capacity declarations
- Natural correction through provider discretion
```

#### What if a member stops contributing?

```
Week 20: Alice is active member (MRD: 1.2)

Week 21-24: Alice stops contributing

Other members reduce recognition:
- Bob: 20% → 12%
- Charlie: 15% → 8%
- Dave: 18% → 10%

Week 25:
Alice's MRS: 47% → 30%
Network average: 45%
Alice's MRD: 0.67

Week 26:
Recognition continues to drop
Alice's MRS: 30% → 18%
Alice's MRD: 0.4

0.4 < 0.5 → Alice loses membership

Automatic without governance decision.

Alice can rejoin by contributing again and rebuilding recognition.
```

#### What if two disconnected clusters form?

```
Cluster A: {Alice, Bob, Charlie} - internally connected
Cluster B: {Dave, Eve, Frank} - internally connected
Zero recognition between clusters

Within Cluster A:
- Each member: ~40% MRS

Within Cluster B:
- Each member: ~40% MRS

If computed as one network:
- Average MRS: 40%
- All have MRD ≈ 1.0
- All are members

But practically:
- Cluster A makes collective capacity declarations without Cluster B
- Cluster B makes collective capacity declarations without Cluster A
- No cross-cluster claims or responses

This is fine - two sub-communities coexisting in same network.

If they want to integrate:
- Build cross-cluster recognition
- Make cross-cluster collective capacity declarations
- Bridge forms naturally
```

#### What if threshold is too high/low?

```
If too high (e.g., 0.8):
- Many valuable contributors excluded
- Network feels exclusive
- Hard to grow

Solution: Use Decider to lower threshold

If too low (e.g., 0.2):
- Peripheral participants become members
- May dilute quality
- Network feels diffuse

Solution: Use Decider to raise threshold or add minimum recognition filter

Threshold is experimental parameter - adjust based on network health.
```

### 10. The Self-Actualization Economy

#### From Extraction to Mutual Enabling

Traditional economic models are based on extraction:

* Employees extract wages from employers
* Employers extract labor from employees
* Consumers extract value from producers
* Producers extract payment from consumers
* Donors extract gratitude/status from recipients
* Recipients extract resources from donors

Each transaction is zero-sum or extractive. Someone gains, someone loses.

**Free-association is based on mutual enabling:**

```
Alice's water infrastructure enables:
- Bob's agricultural work (Bob recognizes Alice: 15%)
- Foundation X's mission fulfillment (Foundation X recognizes Alice: 15%)
- Local communities' health (Community recognizes Alice: 20%)
- Charlie's research (Charlie recognizes Alice: 8%)

Alice's self-actualization depends on:
- Bob's agricultural innovation (Alice recognizes Bob: 12%)
- Foundation X's capital and legitimacy (Alice recognizes Foundation X: 10%)
- Community's active participation (Alice recognizes Community: 15%)
- Charlie's documentation (Alice recognizes Charlie: 8%)

Everyone enables everyone else's self-actualization.
Recognition measures the enabling relationships.
Resources flow to amplify mutual enabling.
```

**Key properties:**

1. **Non-zero-sum**: Alice enabling Bob doesn't diminish Alice - it's part of Alice's self-actualization
2. **Positive feedback**: More enabling → more recognition → more resources → more enabling
3. **Natural alignment**: Everyone's self-interest is to enable others (that's how you self-actualize)
4. **No extraction**: Resources flow to what enables self-actualization, not extracted from losers to winners

#### Recognition as Truth-Telling About Enablement

**Recognition cannot lie (for long):**

```
If Alice falsely recognizes Bob (Bob doesn't actually enable Alice):
- Alice's self-actualization suffers (wrong allocation of Alice's 100%)
- Alice reduces Bob's recognition naturally (because Alice notices Bob doesn't enable her)
- Alice's recognition becomes more accurate over time

If Alice falsely doesn't recognize Bob (Bob does enable Alice, but Alice doesn't acknowledge):
- Alice's self-actualization still depends on Bob
- But Bob gets less recognition from network
- Bob may reduce contributions (not being recognized)
- Alice's self-actualization suffers from Bob's reduced contribution
- Alice notices and increases Bob's recognition
- Truth emerges through consequences
```

**The system creates pressure toward truth:**

* False recognition hurts your own self-actualization (wrong allocation)
* Missing recognition hurts your own self-actualization (enabler may reduce contribution)
* Accurate recognition optimizes your self-actualization
* Truth-telling is self-interested, not altruistic

#### Provider Lenses as Organizational Intelligence

**Provider capacity declarations reveal organizational perspectives:**

```
Foundation X declares:
  Set: {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave}
  Capacity: $500K for "Water Infrastructure"

Foundation Y declares:
  Set: {Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve}
  Capacity: $300K for "Agriculture"

These aren't competing - they're different organizational lenses.

Foundation X's lens:
- Focuses on water infrastructure
- Recognizes Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave as water-enabling collective
- Allocates to water-related needs within this set

Foundation Y's lens:
- Focuses on agriculture
- Recognizes Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve as agriculture-enabling collective
- Allocates to agriculture-related needs within this set

Both lenses are valid.
Both create coordination opportunities.
Both enable different forms of self-actualization.
```

**No single "correct" organization:**

* Multiple provider lenses
* Multiple perspectives on who can effectively use resources
* Multiple coordination pathways
* Prismatic coordination (same people, different provider views)

**Intelligence emerges from multiplicity:**

* Network becomes more intelligent as more provider lenses exist
* Each provider lens reveals different enabling relationships
* Providers allocate through their own capacity lenses
* No central planning needed - organizational intelligence is distributed

#### Why This Works: Alignment of Incentives

**In traditional systems, incentives misalign:**

* Grantseekers optimize for grant writing (not impact)
* Donors optimize for visible credit (not effectiveness)
* Committees optimize for defensible decisions (not best outcomes)
* Organizations optimize for survival (not mission)

**In free-association, incentives align:**

```
To get resources, you must:
1. Actually enable others' self-actualization
   → Because that's what generates recognition
   
2. Help others succeed
   → Because their success increases their recognition of you
   
3. Demonstrate real contribution
   → Because that's what providers recognize and allocate toward
   
4. Build genuine enabling relationships
   → Because that's what increases collective-recognition-shares

For providers:
1. Only declare capacity you actually have
   → Because you must allocate what you declare
   
2. Allocate to highest-recognition contributors
   → Because that's what maximizes impact of your resources
   
3. Track outcomes
   → Because successful allocations inform future capacity declarations

You cannot game this system without actually doing the thing.
The only way to win is to genuinely enable self-actualization.
```

**Self-interest becomes pro-social:**

* Your self-interest = enable others (that's how you self-actualize)
* Others' success = your success (they recognize you more)
* Network health = your health (more enabling relationships available)
* Truth-telling = optimal strategy (accurate recognition optimizes your outcomes)

#### Scaling Properties

**Traditional systems scale poorly:**

* More people → more committees → more bureaucracy
* More resources → more gate-keeping → more politics
* More complexity → more rules → less responsiveness

**Free-association scales elegantly:**

```
Network of 10 people:
- 45 potential mutual recognitions
- Each person manages ~9 recognitions
- Provider capacity declarations create coordination

Network of 100 people:
- 4,950 potential mutual recognitions
- Each person still manages ~recognition budget (100%)
- More provider capacity declarations → more coordination pathways
- More providers → more allocations to needs
- More enabling relationships → more self-actualization opportunities

Network of 1,000 people:
- 499,500 potential mutual recognitions
- Each person still manages same recognition budget
- Massive coordination opportunities through provider capacities
- Rich provider network
- Deep specialization possible
- High network effects
```

**Why it scales:**

1. **Fixed individual complexity**: Each person manages 100% recognition (doesn't increase with network size)
2. **Distributed computation**: No central processor bottleneck
3. **Natural clustering**: Sub-networks form around enabling relationships
4. **Multiple coordination layers**: Provider capacities create high-level coordination without requiring all-to-all connections
5. **Provider-need matching**: Automatic discovery of alignment without search committees

**Network effects increase with scale:**

* More providers → better need fulfillment rates
* More provider capacity declarations → more coordination opportunities
* More enabling relationships → more self-actualization pathways
* More specialization → higher quality enabling contributions

### 11. Administrative Entity Integration

#### Overview

The Free-Association protocols are **implementation-agnostic**. They can operate with any legal or administrative structure that provides:

1. **Legal personality** or fiscal host relationship (ability to hold/access funds)
2. **Execution mechanism** (admins who can approve/execute transfers)
3. **Transparency layer** (public or member-visible ledger)
4. **Compliance framework** (KYC/AML as required by jurisdiction)

**Key principle:** The administrative entity/host doesn't decide anything - it acknowledges and executes what the protocols compute.

#### Implementation Patterns

The protocols can be wrapped by:

**A. Incorporated Entity (e.g., Swiss Verein, US 501(c)(3))**

* Own legal status and bank account
* Admins selected by MRD ranking (opt-in)
* Constitutional document references protocols
* See: [playnet.gitbook.io/docs/fiscal-interfaces/swiss-association](https://playnet.gitbook.io/docs/organizations/swiss-association) for Swiss Verein implementation

**B. Fiscally Hosted Collective (e.g., via Open Collective Europe)**

* No own legal status (uses host's)
* No own bank account (host holds funds)
* Admins approve expenses on platform
* Operating guidelines reference protocols
* See: [playnet.gitbook.io/docs/fiscal-interfaces/open-collective](https://playnet.gitbook.io/docs/organizations/open-collective) for hosted implementation

**C. DAO/Smart Contract (future)**

* On-chain execution
* Automated compliance via oracles
* No traditional admins (code executes)

#### Core Integration Requirements

Regardless of implementation, all structures need:

**1. Membership Registry**

```
Input: Recognition data from participants
Computation: Weekly MRD calculation
Output: Current member list (MRD ≥ threshold)
Interface: Admins/members can view list
```

**2. Resource Tracking**

```
Input: Available balance/capacity
Computation: Allocation based on recognition + needs + filters
Output: Transfer instructions {recipient, amount, rationale}
Interface: Admins receive and execute instructions
```

**3. Execution Mechanism**

```
Role: Admins or automated system
Action: Execute transfers per protocol output
Discretion: None (mechanical execution only)
Recording: All transactions in transparent ledger
```

**4. Compliance Layer**

```
Source: Compliance service, fiscal host, or oracle
Data: Filter(Member) for each member ($0, $X, or Unlimited)
Application: Protocol applies filters before allocation computation
Override: Not possible by admins
```

**5. Transparency**

```
Public or member-visible:
- Recognition patterns (may be anonymized)
- MRD scores and membership status
- Allocations and rationale
- Collective-recognition-shares
- All transactions
```

#### Implementation-Specific Details

For complete implementation guides including:

* Legal requirements and mappings
* Admin selection and responsibilities
* Compliance procedures
* Financial record keeping
* Meeting protocols
* Step-by-step setup instructions

**See implementation-specific documentation:**

* **Swiss Verein**: playnet.gitbook.io/docs/fiscal-interfaces/swiss-association
* **Open Collective Hosted**: playnet.gitbook.io/docs/fiscal-interfaces/open-collective
* **Other jurisdictions**: Adapt patterns from above examples

#### Generic Operational Flow

**For any implementation:**

```
1. Members submit recognition data (via protocol interface)
   → Protocol computes MRD scores weekly
   → Membership list updated

2. Members declare needs (via protocol interface)
   → All needs visible to network
   → Needs tagged by type/purpose

3. Providers declare capacities (via protocol interface)
   → Capacity includes: set of members, total amount, type
   → Protocol computes collective-recognition-shares within set

4. Protocol allocates (automatic for entity's own funds)
   → Based on: recognition shares + needs + available capacity + compliance filters
   → Output: Transfer instructions

5. Admins execute (mechanical, no discretion)
   → Verify protocol authenticity
   → Execute transfers via available mechanism:
     * Bank transfers (incorporated entity)
     * Platform expense approval (hosted collective)
     * Smart contract execution (DAO)
   → Record all transactions

6. Transparency (continuous)
   → All allocations visible with rationale
   → Public or member-visible budget
   → Recognition patterns observable
   → Full audit trail
```

#### Key Principles Across All Implementations

* **Admins never decide allocations** - Protocol computes based on recognition
* **Compliance filters are computational** - Applied before admin sees instructions
* **Membership is automatic** - MRD computation determines who participates
* **Resources flow by recognition** - Not by voting or discretionary approval
* **Transparency is mandatory** - All transactions and rationale visible
* **No governance overhead** - Computation replaces committees and approvals

***

**Note:** Section 11 previously contained detailed Swiss Verein-specific examples. These have been moved to `statutes.md` to keep this protocol specification implementation-agnostic. The protocol described here works identically whether wrapped by a Swiss Verein, an Open Collective hosted collective, a US 501(c)(3), or any other administrative structure.

### 12. Summary

#### Free-Association

**Philosophical Foundation:**

Recognition = Your acknowledgment of contributions to YOUR self-actualization

* Each person has 100% to distribute (your complete self-actualization)
* Non-transferable (only you can judge what enables you)
* Dynamically adjustable (as enabling relationships change)
* Includes both direct contributions and contributions to values/conditions you need

Mutual Recognition = min(recognition in both directions)

* Ensures reciprocity in proportion
* Measures genuine mutual interdependence
* One-sided recognition doesn't create mutual relationship

Resources flow to what enables self-actualization

* Not charity or altruism - mutual enabling
* Providers invest in their own self-actualization by allocating to needs
* Everyone is both enabling and enabled
* Non-zero-sum: your enabling others IS your self-actualization

**Three Computational Mechanisms:**

1. **Membership Module** → Determines who participates (MRD ≥ threshold)
2. **Resource Allocation** → Allocates resources (provider capacities + needs)
3. **Decider** → Tunes parameters (rarely, weighted by MRD)

**Zero Governance:**

* No appointments (admins = top MRD, opt-in)
* No committees (computation handles all)
* No approval processes (MRD determines membership)
* No voting (except rare Decider for parameters)
* No centralized planning (provider lenses create coordination)
* No grant applications (needs + provider allocations)

**Complete Functionality:**

* Membership emerges from mutual recognition patterns
* Resources flow to recognized needs through provider allocations
* Success amplifies automatically (higher recognition → higher collective-recognition-shares)
* Failure corrects automatically (lower recognition → lower collective-recognition-shares)
* Roles emerge from recognition patterns (who's recognized for what)
* Priorities emerge from allocation patterns (what gets fulfilled)
* Quality emerges from enabling outcomes (what actually helps self-actualization)

**Self-Correcting Properties:**

* Phantom capacity eliminated (only providers with actual resources declare capacity)
* False recognition hurts your own self-actualization (wrong allocation)
* Success increases recognition (enabling others → they recognize you more)
* Failure decreases recognition (not enabling → recognition drops)
* Stop contributing → lose membership (MRD drops below threshold)
* Truth-telling is optimal strategy (accurate recognition optimizes outcomes)

**Scaling Properties:**

* Fixed individual complexity (always manage 100% recognition)
* Distributed computation (no bottlenecks)
* Natural clustering (sub-networks around enabling relationships)
* Multiple coordination layers (provider capacities)
* Network effects increase with scale (more providers, more coordination opportunities)

**Implementation Integration:**

* Administrative entity is thin wrapper around protocols
* Admins = top participants by MRD (opt-in)
* Admins execute protocol outputs (don't make decisions)
* Members acknowledge computational results (formality)
* Legal requirements handled by administrative structure
* Zero governance overhead (computation does the work)
* Even entity's own funds are allocated computationally (admins never decide)

**The Key Insight:**

Traditional fiscal interfaces require governance because they assume:

* Someone must decide who belongs
* Someone must decide who gets resources
* Someone must monitor performance
* Someone must coordinate activity

Free-association eliminates need for governance by recognizing:

* Recognition patterns determine who belongs (MRD computation)
* Recognition patterns determine resource flows (provider allocations based on collective recognition)
* Recognition patterns measure performance (recognition increases/decreases)
* Recognition patterns create coordination (provider capacities + need matching)

**Result:** An organization that operates through recognition of mutual enabling, with computational mechanisms handling all coordination, and administrative wrapper for compliance only.

Everyone participates by recognizing what enables them. Resources flow to what's recognized as enabling. The system optimizes for genuine mutual enabling because that's what generates recognition.

The organization is a **computational protocol for mutual self-actualization**.
