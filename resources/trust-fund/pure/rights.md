# Legal Powers of a Swiss Verein: Implied, Statutory, and Licensed

## The Fundamental Question

Which powers does a Swiss Verein possess **automatically** under Swiss civil law (ZGB), which **should be explicitly stated** in its statutes for legal clarity, and which require **external authorization** from regulators?

This analysis uses the **Swiss Civil Code (ZGB, Articles 60–79)** as the baseline legal framework.

---

## 1. Legal Foundations

### What is a Swiss Verein?

Under **Art. 60 ZGB**, an association (*Verein*) is an organized group pursuing a common purpose other than commercial profit-sharing.

### Acquiring Legal Personality

**Art. 60 Para. 1 ZGB:** An association acquires legal personality (becomes a legal entity) when:

1. **Organizational intent** is expressed in statutes; and
2. **Corporate organs** (at minimum: General Assembly and Board) are constituted.

**Art. 60 Para. 2 ZGB:** Legal personality arises:
- **Automatically** for non-profit associations with ideal (non-economic) purposes
- **Upon registration** in the commercial register for associations with economic purposes

**Art. 61 ZGB:** The statutes must contain:
1. Purpose
2. Resources (how it will be funded)
3. Organization (organs and their powers)

### Consequences of Legal Personality

Once legal personality is acquired (Art. 52 ZGB applies by analogy):

**The Verein can:**
- Own property in its own name
- Enter contracts as a party
- Sue and be sued in court
- Accumulate assets and liabilities distinct from members
- Continue existing despite membership changes

**Key principle:** The Verein has **full legal capacity** (*Rechtsfähigkeit*) and **capacity to act** (*Handlungsfähigkeit*) through its organs.

### The Three-Layer Framework

All powers of a Verein derive from:

1. **Mandatory law** (ZGB Articles 60–79) - Cannot be opted out
2. **Dispositive law** (Default rules that statutes can modify) - Can customize
3. **Statutory freedom** (What statutes can freely determine) - Wide discretion

Additionally, **special laws** may restrict or require authorization for specific activities (BankA, FINMA, data protection, etc.).

---

## 2. Powers Inherent in Legal Personality (Implied Rights)

These powers arise **automatically** from acquiring legal personality under Art. 60 ZGB. No explicit statutory provision is legally required, though clarity is good practice.

### 2.1 Property and Patrimony

**Source:** Art. 52 ZGB (legal personality), Art. 641 ZGB (ownership)

**Powers:**
- Hold property (movable and immovable) in the Verein's name
- Open and maintain bank accounts
- Receive donations, grants, and other transfers
- Accumulate reserves and manage treasury
- Hold intellectual property rights (if created by/for the Verein)

**Legal note:** The Verein's patrimony is **separate** from members' personal assets. Members have no individual claim on Verein assets (Art. 71 ZGB).

### 2.2 Contracting Authority

**Source:** Legal personality + Art. 19-40 ZGB (obligations law)

**Powers:**
- Enter binding contracts (purchase, lease, service agreements)
- Employ staff (subject to labor law compliance)
- Engage contractors and suppliers
- Join other organizations or networks
- Grant mandates to third parties

**Limitation:** Contracts must be within the Verein's stated purpose (ultra vires doctrine applies).

### 2.3 Governance and Organization

**Source:** Art. 63–67 ZGB (mandatory organs)

**Powers:**
- Convene General Assembly (Art. 64 ZGB - mandatory organ)
- Appoint Board members (Art. 69 ZGB - mandatory organ)
- Establish internal procedures and regulations
- Create committees or working groups (Art. 69 Para. 2 ZGB)
- Delegate operational matters to Board

**Mandatory minimum:**
- General Assembly must exist (Art. 64 ZGB)
- Board must exist (Art. 69 ZGB)
- General Assembly has certain non-delegable powers (see Art. 65 ZGB)

### 2.4 Membership Administration

**Source:** Art. 70–72 ZGB

**Powers:**
- Admit new members (Art. 70 ZGB)
- Expel members with cause (Art. 72 ZGB) - requires fair procedure
- Accept membership resignations (Art. 71 ZGB)
- Determine membership criteria (within statutes)
- Charge membership fees (if provided in statutes or purpose)

**Important:** Expulsion requires:
- Statutory basis or valid cause
- Fair hearing (Art. 72 Para. 2 ZGB)
- General Assembly decision (if provided in statutes)

### 2.5 Legal Standing and Representation

**Source:** Art. 69 ZGB (representation), Art. 75 ZGB (court access)

**Powers:**
- Sue and be sued in court
- Participate in administrative proceedings
- Sign legal documents through authorized organs
- Represent members collectively (in matters related to purpose)
- Enforce claims and defend against claims

**Representation:** Board represents the Verein externally (Art. 69 ZGB). Statutes can define scope and signature rules (collective vs. individual).

### 2.6 Constitutional Autonomy

**Source:** Art. 64 ZGB (General Assembly powers)

**Powers:**
- Amend statutes (Art. 64 lit. a ZGB)
- Voluntarily dissolve (Art. 76 ZGB)
- Merge with other associations (by analogy to company law)
- Transform purpose (within legal limits)
- Reorganize internal structure

**Limitations:** 
- Cannot amend away mandatory provisions (Art. 60–79 ZGB)
- Purpose changes must remain within Vereinsrecht framework
- Asset distribution on dissolution must comply with purpose (Art. 77 ZGB)

### 2.7 Summary: What's Automatic

✅ **No external authorization needed**
✅ **No explicit statutory provision legally required** (though recommended for clarity)
✅ **Inherent in legal personality itself**

**These powers exist by operation of law from the moment legal personality is acquired.**

---

## 3. Powers Requiring or Benefiting from Explicit Statutory Provision

**Legal distinction:** Most of these are not strictly *required* by law to be in statutes, but their **absence creates legal uncertainty**. Explicit provision provides:
- Clarity for third parties (banks, courts, regulators)
- Authority for organs to act
- Protection against ultra vires challenges
- Evidence of intent in disputes

### 3.1 Legally Mandatory Statutory Provisions

**These MUST be in statutes under ZGB:**

| Requirement | ZGB Article | Content |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Art. 61 | What the association aims to achieve |
| **Resources** | Art. 61 | How it will be funded (fees, donations, etc.) |
| **Organization** | Art. 61 | Structure of organs and their powers |

**Additionally mandatory if applicable:**

| Situation | Provision Required | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Membership fees** | Amount or determination method | Art. 61 (resources) requires clarity on financial obligations |
| **Non-GA expulsion** | Authority of other organ | Art. 72 ZGB default: only GA can expel |
| **Restricted representation** | Limitation on Board powers | Art. 69 ZGB default: Board has full authority |
| **Dissolution asset distribution** | Destination of assets | Art. 77 ZGB: must align with purpose |

### 3.2 Strongly Recommended for Legal Clarity

**Not strictly required by ZGB, but necessary for practical operation:**

**Financial Operations**
- Investment of reserves beyond simple banking
- Authority to hold multiple accounts
- Authority to hold cryptocurrency or digital assets
- Authority to extend credit or loans (carefully - may trigger regulation)
- Treasury management parameters

**Why:** Banks may refuse services without statutory authority. Auditors and authorities expect clear financial mandates. Investment activities without statutory basis may expose Board to personal liability.

**Commercial Activities**
- Sale of goods or services related to purpose
- Pricing authority
- Commercial partnerships
- Licensing of IP
- Revenue-generating activities

**Why:** "Non-profit" status doesn't prohibit commercial activity, but activity must serve the purpose. Explicit statutory provision demonstrates purpose-alignment and protects tax-exempt status if applicable.

**Governance Innovations**
- Computational or algorithmic decision-making
- Non-traditional member selection (e.g., MRD computation)
- Digital or remote participation
- Delegation to automated systems
- Committee structures beyond simple working groups

**Why:** Swiss courts expect traditional Vereinsrecht structures. Novel mechanisms should be explicitly authorized to withstand legal challenge.

**Structural Powers**
- Creation of subsidiaries or special-purpose vehicles
- Participation in other legal entities
- International branches or chapters
- Merger or transformation authority beyond Art. 76 ZGB
- Multi-tier membership structures

**Why:** These extend the Verein's legal footprint. Explicit authority demonstrates capacity and protects against ultra vires claims.

**Novel Assets and Mechanisms**
- Issuance of tokens or digital units
- Management of DAO structures
- Operation of smart contracts
- Holding of NFTs or digital property
- Cryptographic key management

**Why:** These are legally novel. Courts and regulators lack established frameworks. Statutory provision demonstrates intentional design and provides legal foundation.

### 3.3 The Ultra Vires Doctrine

**Principle:** A Verein can only act within its stated purpose and powers.

**Implications:**
- Acts beyond purpose may be **voidable**
- Board members may face **personal liability** for ultra vires acts
- Third parties may **refuse to transact** without clear statutory authority

**Protection:** Broad purpose statements ("to promote X through any lawful means") + explicit power grants ("may engage in commercial activities consistent with its purpose").

### 3.4 Practical Statutory Design

**Best practice:**

```
Article X - Powers

The Association may, in furtherance of its purpose:
a) Manage financial assets including reserves, investments, and digital assets
b) Engage in commercial activities including [specific activities]
c) Establish working groups, committees, and delegate operational authority
d) Participate in or create other legal entities
e) Issue internal units or tokens for coordination purposes
f) Utilize computational or algorithmic processes for governance
g) Enter into partnerships, collaborations, and networks
h) Employ any lawful means consistent with its purpose
```

**Effect:** Broad authorization while remaining within purpose. Flexibility for evolution without constant statute amendments.

### 3.5 Summary: Explicit Statutory Provisions

**Legally mandatory:** Purpose, resources, organization, and specific ZGB-required items
**Strongly recommended:** Any activity that:
- Involves financial risk or complexity
- Deviates from traditional Vereinsrecht patterns
- May be questioned by banks, regulators, or courts
- Requires third-party confidence in authority

---

## 4. Activities Requiring External Authorization

These activities trigger **special regulatory frameworks** beyond Vereinsrecht. Authorization or compliance is mandatory before commencing such activities.

### 4.1 Financial Market Regulation (FINMA)

**Regulatory authority:** Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)

#### Banking Activities (BankA - Banking Act)

**Requires FINMA banking license:**
- Accepting deposits from the public on a commercial basis
- Managing third-party funds as principal business
- Payment services beyond simple transfers

**Does NOT require license:**
- Managing own assets (Verein's own treasury)
- Receiving donations/grants (not "deposits")
- One-time or occasional fund collection for specific purpose

**Key distinction:** **Public** + **Commercial** + **Deposits** = Banking license needed

#### Financial Intermediation (FinIA - Financial Institutions Act)

**Requires FINMA authorization:**
- Asset management for third parties (portfolio management)
- Investment advisory as commercial service
- Collective investment scheme operation
- Holding client assets in custody

**Exception - "Opting out":**
- Pure advisory (no asset management)
- Managing assets of fewer than 20 investors
- Managing only qualified investors (>CHF 500K net worth or >CHF 2M assets)

#### Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (DLT)

**FINMA assessment required for:**

**Payment tokens (cryptocurrency):**
- If issuing token intended as means of payment → May require banking/payment license
- If facilitating exchange of crypto → May require exchange license
- If providing crypto custody for third parties → Requires VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license

**Security tokens:**
- If token represents share, debt, or derivative → Securities regulation applies
- If offered publicly → Prospectus requirements
- If traded on exchange → Trading venue regulation

**Utility tokens:**
- Generally no FINMA regulation if pure utility (access to service)
- BUT: If tradeable or investable → May be recharacterized as security

**Safe harbor for Vereins:**
- Internal coordination tokens (not tradeable, not sold publicly)
- No profit distribution rights
- Used only within member network for coordination
- → Likely no FINMA regulation, but get written guidance

#### Collective Investment Schemes (CISA)

**Requires FINMA authorization:**
- Pooling capital from multiple investors
- For collective investment
- With profit distribution
- Managed by third party

**Exception:** 
- Fewer than 20 investors (private scheme)
- Qualified investors only
- No public offering

### 4.2 Data Protection (FADP - Federal Act on Data Protection)

**Swiss FADP and EU GDPR apply**

**Compliance required when:**
- Processing personal data of Swiss residents (FADP)
- Processing personal data of EU residents (GDPR)
- Cross-border data transfers
- Automated decision-making affecting individuals

**Key obligations:**
- Legal basis for processing (consent, contract, legitimate interest)
- Data protection impact assessment (for high-risk processing)
- Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)
- Data breach notification
- Privacy policy publication

**Verein context:**
- Member databases → Personal data
- Recognition systems tracking individuals → Personal data
- Computational protocols using member data → Requires legal basis
- International network → Cross-border transfer rules

**Important:** FADP doesn't require licensing, but **compliance is mandatory**. Violations can lead to fines and civil liability.

### 4.3 Tax and Employment

#### Employment (Social Security)

**Mandatory when hiring employees:**
- AHV/AVS registration (social security)
- Accident insurance (SUVA or private)
- Pension fund (BVG) if salary >CHF 22,050/year
- Family allowance fund registration
- Withholding tax for foreign employees

**Not required for:**
- Pure volunteers (no employment relationship)
- Board members acting in organ capacity (unless separately employed)
- Independent contractors (but classification matters)

#### Tax Status

**Federal level:** Associations not automatically tax-exempt

**Cantonal level:** Public benefit associations may qualify for tax exemption if:
- Purpose is public benefit (charitable, educational, cultural)
- Activities exclusively serve that purpose
- No profit distribution to members
- Assets dedicated to purpose (including on dissolution)

**Requirement:** Must apply for tax-exempt status with cantonal authorities. Not automatic.

### 4.4 Commercial Register

**Voluntary registration** for most associations (Art. 60 ZGB)

**Mandatory registration when:**
- Purpose requires commercial operations (economic activity)
- Revenues exceed certain threshold (varies by canton)
- Employing staff on commercial basis
- Board wants enhanced legal certainty

**Effects of registration:**
- Public record of existence, purpose, Board
- Enhanced credibility with third parties
- Certain formal requirements (audit, publication)
- More legal formality but stronger legal position

### 4.5 Sectoral Regulations

#### Food and Health Products

- Selling food → Cantonal food safety registration
- Health claims → Swissmedic if therapeutic claims
- Supplements → Must comply with product safety law

#### Events and Public Safety

- Public events >300 people → Cantonal permits
- Alcohol service → License
- Fire safety, security → Municipal approval

#### Education and Accreditation

- Issuing certificates → Generally permissible
- Official recognition → Requires cantonal education authority approval
- Using protected titles ("university," "hochschule") → Forbidden without authorization

### 4.6 International Operations

**Operating abroad:**
- Must comply with local association/nonprofit law
- May need local registration or tax status
- Cannot assume Swiss law protections apply

**Cross-border funding:**
- Receiving foreign funds → Generally permissible
- Anti-money laundering compliance required
- Report foreign donations if large (varies by canton)

### 4.7 Decision Framework: Do We Need Authorization?

**Ask:**

1. **Are we managing money for others?** → Potential FINMA
2. **Are we issuing tradeable tokens?** → Potential FINMA
3. **Do we process personal data?** → FADP/GDPR compliance (no license, but mandatory)
4. **Are we employing people?** → Social security registration
5. **Are we operating commercially?** → Commercial register + tax assessment
6. **Are we making health/food claims?** → Product regulation
7. **Are we hosting public events?** → Permits
8. **Are we operating internationally?** → Local law compliance

### 4.8 Summary: When External Authorization is Needed

**FINMA licensing** (before commencing activity):
- Banking, asset management, collective investment, crypto custody for others, securities issuance

**Registration/notification** (before or promptly after commencing):
- Employment (AHV), commercial register (if mandatory), tax status application

**Compliance** (ongoing, no prior approval):
- Data protection (FADP/GDPR), general contract law, labor law, product safety

**Permits** (case-by-case):
- Events, food service, alcohol, sectoral activities

**General principle:** When in doubt, especially regarding FINMA, **get written guidance** before proceeding. Unauthorized financial activity carries severe penalties.

## 5. Consolidated Summary

### Three-Layer Framework

| Layer | Legal Status | Examples | Source of Authority |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Inherent Powers** | Automatic from legal personality | Own property, contract, sue, organize, amend statutes | ZGB Art. 60–79 |

## 6. Design Principles for Antifragile Statutes

### Maximize Flexibility Within Legal Boundaries

**Purpose Statement:**
```
❌ Too narrow: "To provide water filtration in Uganda"
→ Limits evolution, requires amendments

✓ Optimal: "To facilitate bioregional regenerative projects through 
computational coordination mechanisms"
→ Broad, flexible, legally sound
```

**Powers Clause:**
```
Article X - Powers

The Association may, in furtherance of its purpose, employ any lawful means including:
a) Managing assets and reserves in any form
b) Engaging in commercial activities consistent with its purpose
c) Utilizing computational or algorithmic processes for coordination
d) Establishing subsidiaries, partnerships, or collaborations
e) Issuing internal coordination mechanisms
f) Delegating operational authority to designated persons or systems
g) Any other activity consistent with its purpose and permitted by law
```

**Effect:** Maximum flexibility without requiring statute amendments for operational evolution.

### Avoid Regulatory Triggers

**Safe harbor design:**

✓ **Manage own assets** (not others' money)
✓ **Receive voluntary contributions** (not deposits)
✓ **Issue non-tradeable coordination tokens** (not securities)
✓ **Computational membership** (explicitly authorized in statutes)
✓ **Distribute based on purpose** (not profit-sharing)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Managing third-party investments commercially
- Issuing tradeable tokens promising returns
- Public fundraising for investment
- Commercial banking or custody services
- Profit distribution to members

### Layer Protections

**For high-risk or experimental activities:**

1. **Maintain clean Verein** for core operations
2. **Use subsidiaries** for:
   - Commercial activities
   - International operations
   - Novel token issuances
   - High-liability activities
3. **Firewall liability** through separate legal entities
4. **Preserve Verein** as coordination hub

**Example structure:**
```
Playnet Verein (Swiss)
  → Owns and governs
  
  Playnet Services GmbH (Swiss)
    → Commercial operations
    
  Playnet Foundation (Liechtenstein)
    → Token issuance
    
  Playnet DAO (Decentralized)
    → Experimental governance
```

### Build in Adaptation Mechanisms

**From statutes:**
```
Article 9 - Amendment

These Statutes may be amended via Decider process. 
The General Assembly adopts Decider results. 
Any article may be amended, provided amendments comply with Swiss Civil Code.
```

**Effect:** Constitutional flexibility through single amendment pathway. Can adapt to regulatory changes, operational needs, or community evolution without rigid procedures.

## 8. Conclusion

**Key insights:**

1. **Most powers are inherent** - A Verein with legal personality can do almost anything consistent with its purpose
2. **Statutes provide clarity** - Explicit provisions protect against challenges and enable third-party confidence
3. **Special regulations are narrow** - Only specific financial activities trigger FINMA; most operations are freely permitted
4. **Flexibility is achievable** - Broad purpose + powers clause + simple amendment = adaptable structure
5. **Regulatory compliance is manageable** - Stay within safe harbors (own assets, non-tradeable tokens, computational coordination)

**The Playnet model:**
- Computational governance → **Explicitly authorized in statutes** (no external regulation)
- Own treasury → **Inherent power** (no FINMA)
- Internal coordination tokens → **Statutory authority** (likely no FINMA if non-tradeable)
- Distributed decision-making → **Statutory authorization** (novel but lawful)
- Swiss Verein wrapper → **Thin legal layer** over computational protocols

**Result:** Legally sound, regulatorily light, maximally flexible structure for distributed coordination.
