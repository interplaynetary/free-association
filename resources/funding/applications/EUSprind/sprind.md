Shape the Future: Design the Next SPRIND Challenge

What would you do with 50 million euros to radically advance our civilization’s technological capabilities?
Chances are, your answer wouldn’t just be a scaled-up version of what you’re doing today. You might have a pressing issue in mind—but not yet a clear path to solve it. That’s where SPRIND Challenges come in.

SPRIND Challenges are designed to solve civilization-scale problems by backing visionary teams with the resources to advance their solutions. They are far from your typical research grant. They are missions with a clear, measurable goal—and the pace and flexibility needed to maximize the chances of reaching it.

This model works. The internet, mRNA vaccines or self-driving cars all came from government-supported coordinated research programs and challenges that shared one feature: they were led by a deep technical leader with a high degree of autonomy and willingness to take a step back from the bench into a role with higher leverage.

There is currently no clear pathway for technical visionaries to get the skills and support needed to develop such programs.

That’s why SPRIND is partnering with Renaissance Philanthropy on the Big if True Science Accelerator (BiTS) program.

We’re looking for up to 10 scientists or engineers across the globe that have the ambition to turn their ideas into transformative programs in Europe.
BiTS is a 13-week, ten hours per week program designed around 1:1 mentorship from experienced DARPA program leaders that distills the knowledge and walks you through all the steps, from field exploration to technology transition, from a high-level idea to a concrete plan you can pitch to funders. The best part: there’s a real chance you can implement your program—at SPRIND, another committed agency, a leading foundation, or others.

Desired candidates reach beyond scientific excellence. They have the rare ability to bridge diverse domains to turn ideas into transformative solutions and combine strengths across two or more domains, such as academia, startups, industry, or investment. We are excited to work with technical leaders around the world who are interested in building the future within the European ecosystem.

Who’s behind the
SPRIND x BiTS accelerator?
SPRIND, the Federal Agency for Breakthrough Innovation, has launched eleven innovation challenges (more than 100 million euros combined budget) since 2021 covering broad-spectrum antivirals, autonomous flight or circular biomanufacturing and many other issues. Under the leadership of Jano Costard, Head of Challenges, SPRIND has established founder-centric funding and support processes—often transferring funds to innovators within just two to three weeks. SPRIND’s agile model has earned international recognition, including a mention in the Draghi report as a key instrument for fostering innovation across Europe.

Renaissance Philanthropysupport philanthropists and foundations in developing and implementing ambitious strategies leveraging science, technology, and innovation. BiTS leaders JP Chretien and Joshua Elliott have programmed hundreds of millions of dollars on moonshots in AI for science, robotics and medicine. Renaissance Philanthropy's CEO and BiTS advisor Tom Kalil played a key role in launching initiatives like the 40 billion dollar National Nanotechnology Initiative and the BRAIN Initiative during his time at the White House for Presidents Clinton and Obama.

The Renaissance Philanthropy team has recently validated this model in partnership with UK’s ARIA.
