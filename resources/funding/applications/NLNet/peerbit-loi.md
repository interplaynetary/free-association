LETTER OF MUTUAL INTENT

We, Rüzgar Imski, a contributor to the Playnet network, and [Name], a contributor to the Peerbit network (hereinafter "we", "us", or "contributors"), hereby express our mutual intent to collaborate, each bringing the distributed capacities available to us through our respective networks.

We recognize that we are individual contributors within already-distributed networks. This letter expresses our personal commitment to mutual self-actualization through the capacities made available to us via Playnet and Peerbit respectively.

For decades, the dream of harnessing idle devices and human potential for planetary-scale collaboration has stalled. Projects like SETI@Home, Folding@Home, and blockchain networks prove the technical feasibility — but fail to solve the human problem: Why would anyone contribute resources without meaningful alignment to their values? Token rewards and abstract altruism fall short. Through our collaboration, we aim to demonstrate how Free-Association x Peerbit solves this by grounding incentives in mutual self-actualization, creating a system where spare compute, skills, time, or care flows only to those advancing goals we mutually care about.

Traditional models treat resources as commodities: compute sold for money (AWS), cars rented for tokens (blockchain), or time donated to nonprofits, blindly supporting systems that might contradict our values. Our collaboration aims to flip this logic. By leveraging the capacities available to us through our respective networks, we can demonstrate how surplus flows to contributors who directly or transitively advance each other's well-being, proportional to our mutual recognition of contributions.

As a contributor to Playnet, I (Rüzgar) will organize (express/experiment with organization of) plays (playful organizational forms) and technologies (natural, social, communicational, economic etc.) that increase our capacities to recognize, read, (re)-write, and perform plays.

As a contributor to Peerbit, I ([Name]) will leverage the network's decentralized data storage and replication framework to enable the distribution of resources based on mutual contribution scores. I will utilize Peerbit's infrastructure as a foundation upon which we can experiment with Free-Association's mutual recognition logic.

Together, we will collaborate to advance our reciprocally valued goals, focusing on integrating Free-Association's economic coordination patterns with Peerbit's technical capabilities.

We commit to:

1. Share our technical expertise and the resources available to us through our networks
2. Collaborate on developing APIs and standards for mutual recognition in distributed systems
3. Support each other in funding applications and community building efforts
4. Contribute to documentation and educational resources that explain our shared vision

We agree to support each other with the R&D capacities and funding opportunities available to us through our respective networks. Furthermore, we will share knowledge and expertise gained through our network participation. Our goal is to demonstrate how distributed networks can promote plays that are ethical, sustainable and create positive impact.

Specifically, our collaboration will focus on:

1. Implementing Free-Association's mutual contribution model using Peerbit's decentralized data storage framework
2. Experimenting with storage and compute capacity distribution based on mutual contribution scores
3. Developing replication strategies based on mutual fulfillment scores, contributor counts, and capacity quantities
4. Building a dynamic repartitioning system that continuously updates mutual fulfillment scores between nodes

This non-binding indication of mutual intent is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any legally binding obligation on either of us or our respective networks. Neither we nor our networks shall be bound in any way in connection with this letter (other than any separate obligation that may arise with respect to the associated NDA) unless and until we execute a Definitive Agreement, and then shall be bound only in accordance with the terms of such agreement.

We look forward to playing together to realize our reciprocally valued goals, leveraging and contributing to the distributed capacities of our respective networks.

As contributors to our respective networks:

Playnet Contributor, Peerbit Contributor,
