2026 Foresight Fellowship Cohort Application
The Foresight Fellowship is a one-year program committed to giving change-makers the support to accelerate their bold ideas into the future.

Our mission is to catalyze collaboration among leading young scientists, engineers, and innovators who are working on emerging new technologies that have the power to transform society. During the one year program, Fellows are invited to engage in events, connect with current and former fellows and mentors, and help each other succeed in their endeavors.

This can entail:

1-1 introductions to relevant funders, senior scientists, and other mentors.
Travel-paid invitation to one in-person technical workshop.
Travel-paid invitation to one Vision Weekend.
Become a member of a technical Foresight group relevant to your interests
Opportunity to present your work in a Foresight virtual seminar.
Opportunity to share your career successes within Foresight’s and the wider community via our social media and newsletter.
Access to quarterly Fellowship-only virtual career counseling seminars.

Applications for the 2026 cohort close on July 31, 2025.

- Playnet : Founder
  Short biography

- I'm a 24-year-old founder and systems designer building mathematical frameworks for post-capitalist economics. Based in Berlin, I lead Playnet - a diverse network of 50+ activists, developers, and researchers across the globe working on Free-Association: a proven alternative to capitalism that enables spontaneous self-actualization through non-transferable mutual recognition networks. My work bridges theoretical mathematics, distributed technology, and grassroots organizing to create practical tools for equitable resource distribution. I've facilitated hundreds of participants through "play-labs" - experiential workshops where communities design and test new economic systems - and am currently deploying our first large-scale pilot addressing Berlin's housing crisis.

What do you currently work on? Why?

- I'm building Free-Association: a mathematically rigorous alternative to capitalism that solves existential coordination problems through mutual recognition networks. Unlike market systems where transferable money concentrates power, or state systems requiring centralized control, Free-Association uses non-transferable recognition to distribute surplus based on actual contributions to each other's self-actualization.

The mathematics are elegant: your mutual recognition with another equals the minimum of your recognition percentages of each other, ensuring reciprocity. Surplus capacity flows proportionally through these networks, creating exponential access to humanity's cooperative wealth while naturally eliminating false recognition through mathematical constraints.

Why this matters existentially: Current systems force impossible choices between individual survival and collective flourishing. Climate action, housing security, and meaningful work become commodities rather than shared values we can directly organize around. Free-Association breaks this constraint - when recognition is non-transferable and surplus flows through mutual networks, we can finally coordinate at scale around what actually matters for human flourishing and planetary survival.

We're currently piloting housing distribution in Berlin, where several core contributors face housing insecurity despite dedicating their skills to building alternatives. This lived contradiction demonstrates exactly why new coordination mechanisms are essential for existential hope.

How can the Foresight Fellowship help accelerate your work?

- The Fellowship would accelerate Free-Association in three critical ways:

1. **Technical scaling connections**: Our P2P architecture is mathematically sound but could benefit from connections to distributed systems researchers, cryptographic experts, and network theorists who understand large-scale coordination challenges. Foresight's technical network could provide crucial guidance as we scale beyond our current pilot networks.

2. **Existential risk community integration**: Free-Association directly addresses coordination failures that drive existential risks - from climate breakdown to technological misalignment to social collapse. Connecting with researchers studying these challenges could help position our framework as infrastructure for existential hope rather than just an economic alternative.

3. **Cross-pollination with complementary technologies**: I'm particularly interested in how Free-Association might integrate with secure AI systems, biotech cooperatives, or space colonization governance. These technologies need coordination mechanisms that align individual agency with collective flourishing - exactly what our mathematical framework provides.

The Fellowship's emphasis on "emerging technologies that transform society" aligns perfectly with Free-Association's potential to fundamentally restructure how humans coordinate resources, labor, and values at any scale.

Are there specific people or projects in our orbit that we can help you connect with?

- I'd love connections with:

  **Coordination researchers**: Anyone working on large-scale human coordination, mechanism design, or governance systems that avoid both market failures and centralized control. Our mathematical framework for non-transferable recognition could inform their work while benefiting from their insights on scaling challenges.

  **Distributed systems architects**: Researchers building resilient P2P networks, particularly those interested in how cryptographic primitives can enable new forms of social organization. Our current implementation uses Gun.js but could benefit from next-generation distributed database architectures.

  **Existential risk researchers studying social collapse**: Free-Association directly addresses the coordination failures that drive civilizational fragility. I'm particularly interested in connecting with researchers studying how economic inequality, resource distribution failures, and social fragmentation contribute to existential risk.

  **Practitioners building alternative economic systems**: Whether in biotech cooperatives, space settlement governance, or post-scarcity economics research. Free-Association provides mathematical foundations for any context requiring equitable resource distribution without centralized control.

  **AI safety researchers**: Particularly those thinking about alignment and control problems. Our framework for non-transferable recognition might inform approaches to ensuring AI systems serve genuine human flourishing rather than optimizing for transferable metrics that can be gamed.

If you would be given $10K towards your project, what would you do with it?

- With $10K, I would:

  **$4K - Core contributor support**: Provide 3-month stipends for 2-3 developers facing housing insecurity, enabling focused work on critical platform features without survival pressures (exactly the problem Free-Association aims to solve systemically).

  **$3K - Technical infrastructure**: Upgrade our P2P architecture for handling larger networks (improved cryptographic implementations, more robust distributed database systems, enhanced mobile compatibility for accessibility).

  **$2K - Global pilot expansion**: Fund travel and coordination for implementing Free-Association pilots in 3 additional cities, working with local mutual aid networks to test cultural adaptability and gather diverse feedback.

  **$1K - Documentation and educational materials**: Create comprehensive guides, video tutorials, and mathematical explainers to enable other communities to fork and adapt our open-source toolkit.

This allocation reflects Free-Association principles: prioritizing human needs first (housing security for contributors), then building resilient infrastructure, expanding through networks of mutual recognition, and ensuring knowledge remains freely accessible. The impact would compound exponentially as each supported contributor and pilot network becomes a node for further expansion.
