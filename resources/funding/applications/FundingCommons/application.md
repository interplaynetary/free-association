The 2025 Builder Residency is a three-week immersive program designed to support collaboration and experimentation in the public goods and blockchain space. We‚Äôre bringing together around 20 to 25 builders ‚Äî including developers, designers, independent contributors, and members of aligned projects ‚Äî for a focused residency where ideas can take shape and partnerships can grow.

Taking place in Argentina, the residency offers a unique backdrop for builders working at the intersection of decentralized tech and public goods. With its strong local interest in web3 and economic experimentation, Argentina provides a fitting environment for this kind of work.

Residents will take part in weekly sprints, lightning talks, and collaborative sessions. Partner organizations will host workshops to share practical tools and perspectives, complementing the ongoing peer-to-peer exchange that drives the residency. The goal is to create space for meaningful progress, shared learning, and unexpected collaborations.

The program wraps up at the Funding the Commons conference in Buenos Aires, where residents will present what they‚Äôve been working on to a wider community of builders, funders, and researchers.

If you‚Äôre building in this space and want to be part of a focused, community-driven experience, we‚Äôd love to hear from you. Apply below to join the 2025 Builder Residency.

## What do you want to build during the residency

We want to build the practical infrastructure for free-association ‚Äî a mathematical framework that enables the spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other without centralized control, private property, or state intervention.

Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Complete the p2p interface** implementing free-association economics with collective-recognition and collective-capacity distribution.
2. **Establish distributed surplus networks** in Buenos Aires and beyond, connecting housing, skills, food, and time through mutual-recognition relationships
3. **Document and iterate** on real-world experiments, creating replicable models for communities facing housing crises and resource scarcity
4. **Build bridges** between the global public goods ecosystem and post-capitalist economic alternatives rooted in mutual aid and collective creativity

## What is your prior expereince with cryptography/currency/decentralized technologies and/or climate, and public goods funding systems?

Over nine years of full-time exploration in post-capitalist economic design, we've engaged with various decentralized systems before discovering free-association as a legitimate alternative that transcends the limitations we encountered.

**Decentralized Technologies Experience:**

- Built p2p interfaces using Gun.js for distributed data synchronization without centralized points of failure
- Explored blockchain-based governance mechanism, finding them insufficient for true mutual self-actualization. I was a founder of a crypto project called Agency, that seeked to use derivatives for social-movements and public goods funding.

**Public Goods Funding Systems:**

- Experimented with quadratic funding mechanisms, identifying mathematical limitations in addressing false recognition
- Studied retroactive public goods funding, recognizing the need for dynamic rather than fixed recognition attribution
- Spent years exploring equity swaps for non-zero sum mutually-beneficial economic relationships and risk-sharing

**Climate & Real-World Applications:**
Our work directly addresses climate crisis through resource abundance rather than scarcity management ‚Äî when surplus flows according to mutual recognition, overconsumption becomes mathematically disadvantageous while regenerative practices strengthen network connections.

**Key Insight:** Traditional crypto/blockchain solutions still rely on ownership models (tokens, shares, equity) that perpetuate accumulation and the persistence of false recognition. Free-association transcends this by ensuring recognition remains non-transferable and dynamically adjustable, making the Present reign over the Past.

## Tell us about a time you contributed to a collaborative or open-source effort. What did you learn?

Over three years, we've facilitated hundreds of "play-labs" ‚Äî games where communities design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution. Each play-lab is itself a collaborative experiment in collective intelligence.

**The Process:** Communities gather to prototype economic relationships through play. Participants experiment with recognition attribution, surplus distribution, and mutual aid coordination while we document patterns and iterate on shared tools. Everything learned gets integrated into our open-source framework.

**What We Learned:**

1. **False recognition naturally emerges and self-corrects** ‚Äî participants initially try to game systems through inflated recognition, but quickly discover this diminishes their access to actually beneficial surplus. The mathematics of mutual recognition creates inherent incentives for truth.

2. **Consensus isn't necessary for coordination** ‚Äî rather than seeking agreement on abstract principles, participants coordinate through concrete mutual recognition of contributions. Shared action emerges from individual recognition decisions rather than collective decision-making.

3. **Surplus distribution becomes joyful rather than burdensome** ‚Äî when your surplus flows to those who contribute to your self-actualization, sharing becomes an expression of values rather than obligation or charity.

**Key Insight:** Collaborative efforts succeed not through forced cooperation but through creating conditions where individual self-actualization requires mutual contribution. The technical and social architecture must align to make mutual recognition more advantageous than false recognition.

## What does "funding the commons" mean to you, and why is it important?

"Funding the commons" traditionally implies directing resources toward shared infrastructure and public goods. But this framing still operates within scarcity logic ‚Äî allocating limited resources to unlimited needs through centralized decision-making.

**Free-association transforms this entirely:** Instead of "funding" commons, we create conditions where surplus naturally flows to commons through mutual recognition networks. When individuals recognize contributions to their self-actualization, resources flow organically to shared infrastructure, knowledge production, and collective capacities.

Consider housing: Rather than funding affordable housing through taxation or grants, free-association enables those with surplus housing capacity to share with mutual contributors. A programmer's surplus coding capacity flows to those building community infrastructure, whose surplus organizational capacity flows to those creating shared resources, whose surplus material capacity flows back through the network.

**This is crucial because:**

1. **Eliminates artificial scarcity** ‚Äî commons aren't competing for limited funding pools but accessing surplus that naturally emerges from human cooperation
2. **Transcends charity/market false dichotomy** ‚Äî resources flow based on mutual recognition rather than either altruistic sacrifice or profit extraction
3. **Creates antifragile commons** ‚Äî as networks strengthen, more surplus becomes available for shared infrastructure
4. **Enables true scaling** ‚Äî mathematical properties ensure that larger networks generate exponentially more accessible surplus

**The importance:** Traditional funding mechanisms reproduce the very power structures that create commons scarcity in the first place. Free-association dissolves these structures by making mutual contribution to commons the most advantageous individual strategy.

We're not seeking funding for commons ‚Äî we're building the mathematical infrastructure that makes commons funding obsolete by ensuring surplus flows where it creates the most mutual fulfillment.

## What motivate you to contribute to the public goods ecosystem?

We contribute to the public goods ecosystem because we've discovered that **individual self-actualization and collective flourishing are mathematically identical in free-association networks**.

**Personal Motivation:** After nine years exploring post-capitalist alternatives, finding free-association felt like discovering fire ‚Äî a fundamental technology that transforms everything. The mathematical elegance of mutual recognition creating spontaneous abundance without centralized control or private property feels like touching the underlying logic of cooperative human nature.

**Urgent Necessity:** Our Berlin community members face housing insecurity while building alternatives to housing crisis. This isn't abstract theory ‚Äî it's survival. When mutual contributors can't access basic needs while dedicating skills to collective benefit, the system is fundamentally broken.

**Mathematical Certainty:** In free-association, contributing to public goods isn't altruistic sacrifice ‚Äî it's the most effective individual strategy. When you recognize contributors to commons (education, infrastructure, environmental restoration), your surplus flows to strengthen these systems, which strengthens the network that supports your own self-actualization.

**Network Effects:** Every person who joins free-association networks exponentially increases available surplus for everyone. Contributing to public goods ecosystem means building the relational infrastructure that connects all of humanity's cooperative wealth.

**Revolutionary Potential:** Public goods funding traditionally operates through charity (one-way flow) or taxation (coercive extraction). Free-association transcends both by making public goods contribution the optimal individual strategy through mutual recognition mathematics.

**The Real Motivation:** We've glimpsed what becomes possible when the free development of each truly becomes the condition for the free development of all. Once you see this mathematical proof in action, everything else feels like settling for less than human potential.

## Are you currently working on - or interested in building - real-fi solutions (solutions for the real world?) Please elaborate.

Free-association **is** real-fi ‚Äî it directly addresses the most fundamental real-world problems through mathematical infrastructure for resource distribution.

**Current Real-World Implementation:**

**Housing Crisis Response:** In Berlin, we're establishing distributed surplus networks where those with extra housing capacity share with mutual contributors. This isn't theoretical ‚Äî community members facing housing insecurity are accessing space through recognition relationships while contributing skills to collective projects.

**Food Distribution Networks:** Play-labs have prototyped local food surplus sharing where gardeners, cooks, and organizers recognize each other's contributions, creating abundance without market exchange or charity dependency.

**Skill & Time Coordination:** Our p2p interface enables slot-to-slot capacity composition ‚Äî your Tuesday morning coding capacity can compose directly with someone's Tuesday afternoon project coordination, creating precise temporal coordination of collective work.

**Financial Resource Flows:** Operating transparently via Open Collective, we've demonstrated how small donors sustain infrastructure when surplus flows through mutual recognition rather than traditional funding hierarchies.

**Why This Is More "Real" Than Traditional Finance:**

1. **Addresses Root Causes:** Rather than managing scarcity through pricing mechanisms, free-association eliminates artificial scarcity by enabling direct surplus access
2. **No Extractive Intermediaries:** Resources flow directly between mutual contributors without financial institutions capturing value
3. **Solves Coordination Problems:** Slot-aware composition enables supply chains that coordinate in space and time, not just economically
4. **Scales Without Limits:** Mathematical properties ensure larger networks generate exponentially more accessible surplus

**Argentina Focus:** The residency context is perfect for real-fi experimentation ‚Äî economic experimentation culture plus active crypto community creates ideal conditions for testing distributed resource coordination at scale.

## Do privacy-preserving tools or protocols play a role in your work? If so, how?

Privacy in free-association serves mutual recognition rather than individual protection ‚Äî we need privacy-preserving tools that enable authentic relationship building while preventing surveillance and manipulation.

**Current Privacy Implementation:**

**P2P Data Architecture:** Using Gun.js for distributed data synchronization means recognition relationships exist across peer networks rather than centralized servers. No single entity can access or manipulate the complete recognition graph.

**Cryptographic Recognition:** Recognition attributions are cryptographically signed to prevent false attribution while allowing dynamic adjustment. You control your recognition data without depending on centralized authorities.

**Selective Disclosure:** Participants can share different levels of recognition detail with different network participants. Your recognition of someone's housing contributions might be visible to housing network members but not to broader networks.

**Anti-Surveillance Design:** Traditional economic surveillance relies on transaction monitoring. In free-association, surplus flows through recognition relationships rather than monetary transactions, making economic surveillance significantly more difficult.

**Privacy Challenges We're Addressing:**

1. **Recognition Authenticity vs. Privacy:** How to verify genuine mutual recognition while protecting individual relationship details from broader network visibility
2. **Transitive Privacy:** When surplus flows through recognition networks, how to preserve privacy across multiple relationship degrees
3. **Collective Privacy:** How to enable community-level recognition decisions while protecting individual recognition choices

**Why Privacy Matters for Free-Association:**

- **Prevents Manipulation:** External actors can't manipulate recognition networks they can't fully observe
- **Enables Authentic Relationship:** Privacy protection allows genuine recognition without performative social pressure
- **Protects Vulnerable Contributors:** Those in precarious situations can participate without exposing their full circumstances to network observation

Privacy-preserving tools aren't just technical requirements ‚Äî they're essential for creating conditions where mutual recognition can emerge authentically rather than through surveillance or social pressure.

## Have you experimented with or proposed new public goods funding mechanism (e.g. quadratic funding, retroPGD, hypercerts?) tell us more.

We've studied existing mechanisms extensively and found fundamental limitations that free-association transcends:

**Quadratic Funding Analysis:**

- **Limitation:** Still relies on monetary allocation and centralized matching pools
- **Our Alternative:** Recognition attribution creates organic resource flows without requiring monetary intermediation or matching fund coordination

**Retroactive Public Goods Funding Analysis:**

- **Limitation:** Fixed recognition of past contributions that can't adjust to new information about actual impact
- **Our Alternative:** Dynamic recognition adjustment means false recognition naturally decays while true recognition strengthens over time

**Hypercerts Analysis:**

- **Limitation:** Transferable certificates create ownership models that enable accumulation of false recognition
- **Our Alternative:** Non-transferable recognition that remains dynamically adjustable prevents accumulation while enabling precise attribution

**Free-Association as Funding Mechanism Transcendence:**

Rather than proposing another funding mechanism, free-association dissolves the need for funding mechanisms entirely. Here's how:

1. **No Allocation Decisions:** Instead of deciding how to distribute limited resources, surplus flows automatically to mutual contributors through recognition relationships

2. **No Centralized Matching:** Rather than requiring matching funds or centralized coordination, mutual recognition creates bidirectional surplus flows

3. **No Fixed Attribution:** Unlike certificates or tokens that lock in past contributions, recognition adjusts dynamically as relationships and contributions evolve

4. **No Monetary Intermediation:** Resources flow directly between contributors (housing, skills, time, food) without requiring monetary conversion

**Mathematical Innovation:**
The key insight is that mutual recognition mathematics creates conditions where contributing to public goods becomes the optimal individual strategy. Traditional mechanisms try to incentivize public goods contribution through external rewards. Free-association makes public goods contribution intrinsically advantageous through network effects.

**Experimental Validation:**
Our play-labs have demonstrated that when participants recognize each other's contributions to their self-actualization, public goods (shared infrastructure, knowledge, coordination) emerge spontaneously without funding mechanisms.

## How do you think we should measure the impact of public goods?

Traditional impact measurement assumes external evaluation of public goods effectiveness. Free-association transforms this by making impact measurement intrinsic to the system through mutual recognition dynamics.

**Recognition as Impact Measurement:**

In free-association networks, public goods impact is measured by the recognition they receive from those whose self-actualization they support. This creates several advantages over traditional metrics:

1. **Self-Correcting Measurement:** False recognition diminishes access to beneficial surplus, creating inherent incentives for accurate impact assessment
2. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Impact measurement adjusts continuously as actual effects become visible rather than relying on predetermined metrics
3. **Contextual Relevance:** Those directly affected by public goods determine their value rather than external evaluators with different priorities
4. **Network Effects Visibility:** Recognition flows through networks reveal indirect impacts that traditional measurement often misses

**Practical Measurement Approach:**

**Direct Recognition Flows:** How much recognition do public goods contributors receive from direct beneficiaries? This indicates immediate impact on self-actualization.

**Transitive Recognition Networks:** How does recognition flow through networks from public goods contributors? This reveals broader social impact and network strengthening effects.

**Surplus Access Patterns:** Do public goods contributors gain access to diverse surplus capacities through their recognition networks? This demonstrates real social-material impact.

**Network Growth Dynamics:** Do public goods contributions attract new participants to recognition networks? This indicates broader ecosystem strengthening.

**False Recognition Decay:** Do public goods contributions maintain recognition over time or do they decay as actual impacts become clear? This reveals authentic vs. performative impact.

**Why This Approach Is Superior:**

- **No Gaming:** Unlike traditional metrics that can be manipulated, mutual recognition mathematics prevent false impact inflation
- **Holistic Assessment:** Captures both direct and indirect effects through network relationship mapping
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Impact measurement happens continuously rather than through periodic evaluation
- **Participant-Centered:** Those affected determine value rather than external authorities with different priorities

Impact measurement becomes organic to the system rather than an external evaluation burden.

## What kind of people or expertise are you hoping to connect with during the residency?

We seek connections with people who recognize the limitations of current systems and are building practical alternatives, particularly those working at the intersection of economic justice and technical innovation.

**Economic System Designers:** Those experimenting with alternative resource distribution mechanisms, cooperative economics, or post-capitalist organizational structures. We want to explore how free-association mathematics might enhance their work.

**Housing Justice Practitioners:** Organizers working on housing cooperatives, community land trusts, or tenant organizing. Housing crisis is where free-association's surplus distribution logic becomes most immediately practical.

**Mutual Aid Network Builders:** People creating resilient community support systems who understand that mutual aid transcends charity through reciprocal relationship building.

**P2P Technology Developers:** Those building decentralized systems who recognize that technical decentralization without economic transformation often reproduces existing power structures.

**Public Goods Researchers:** Economists, social scientists, or practitioners studying commons governance, collective action problems, or resource sharing mechanisms who might benefit from mathematical frameworks for mutual recognition.

**Community Organizers from Global South:** Practitioners with experience in resource sharing, collective decision-making, or solidarity economy experiments who can provide crucial perspective on scaling alternatives.

**Climate Justice Activists:** Those working on regenerative systems who understand that ecological crisis requires economic transformation rather than just technological solutions.

**Game Designers & Facilitators:** People skilled in creating participatory experiences that help communities explore new relationship patterns and coordination mechanisms.

**User Experience Designers:** Those who understand how interface design shapes social relationships and can help make complex economic mathematics accessible through intuitive interaction design.

We're particularly interested in connecting with people who've experienced the limitations of traditional funding mechanisms and are ready to experiment with fundamentally different approaches to resource coordination.

## What can you offer to others in the cohort

We offer a working mathematical framework that solves fundamental coordination problems others are wrestling with, plus practical experience implementing alternatives at scale.

**Mathematical Infrastructure:** Free-association provides rigorous mathematical foundations for resource distribution that transcends both market and state mechanisms. Others working on economic alternatives often lack mathematical frameworks that scale without reproducing existing power structures.

**P2P Technical Implementation:** Our interface demonstrates how complex economic mathematics can be implemented in user-friendly, distributed systems. We can share both technical architecture and design patterns for building decentralized economic tools.

**Play-Lab Facilitation:** Three years of experience facilitating community economic experimentation. We can design and run sessions where cohort members prototype resource sharing mechanisms, test recognition dynamics, and explore coordination patterns.

**Network Bridging:** Our diverse international community includes housing organizers, cooperative developers, mutual aid practitioners, and technical contributors. We can connect cohort members with relevant practitioners worldwide.

**Economic Theory Translation:** Ability to translate complex post-capitalist economic concepts into accessible frameworks and practical experiments. We can help others articulate their intuitions about alternative economics through mathematical precision.

**Conflict Transformation:** Experience navigating tensions that emerge when groups experiment with new economic relationships. We understand how to work through conflicts that arise when people challenge existing resource distribution patterns.

**Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:** Everything we learn gets integrated into open-source frameworks. We can help others document their experiments in ways that contribute to broader movement knowledge.

**Surplus Capacity:** Housing, technical skills, facilitation, and coordination capacity that we're actively seeking to share with mutual contributors rather than monetize.

**Revolutionary Optimism:** Nine years of exploration have taught us that fundamental alternatives are possible. We offer confidence that current systems can be transcended through practical experimentation rather than just theoretical critique.
