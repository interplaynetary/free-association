Project Title
Democratizing Resource Sharing Through Mutual Recognition Networks

What Is Your Plan?
Free-Association is a distributed platform that strengthens democratic participation by enabling communities to self-organize resource distribution based on mutual recognition and reciprocity. By replacing hierarchical control with dynamic networks, it empowers individuals and organizations to collaboratively allocate surplus (housing, skills, food) according to shared values. The system fosters trust through transparent, algorithm-driven sharing, reducing power imbalances and promoting inclusive decision-making. We aim to pilot the platform with local cooperatives and civic groups, demonstrating how technology can deepen democratic engagement by decentralizing economic agency. Educational workshops and open-source tools will equip communities to adopt this model, fostering grassroots democracy and collective resilience.
