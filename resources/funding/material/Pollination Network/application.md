Budget
What is the minimum funding needed for your project to succeed and reach completion?*
We deeply value your efforts and aim to support as many grassroots projects as possible. By requesting only what you absolutely need, you help us support more individuals working to serve their communities. 

Please share the smallest budget that will allow your project to achieve its goals. We can only fund projects with budgets up to $500. 

Please submit your answer in US dollars only. 
Currency Converter
$1 - $250
$251 - $500
Please read the following budget instructions closely:
We respect your decisions on how to run your project and what it needs to succeed. However, we want to let you know that we cannot fund certain items.

Food or drink
T-shirts or school uniforms
Any product that is harmful to the environment
Animal-based products
Volunteer Stipends (reasonable travel or data-specific stipends will be considered)
Any payments to individuals for their services
Because it is important to us to know how the grant funding will be used, we can only consider applications with budget items that are itemized, specific, and add up to the amount of funding requested from TPP.

Due to the number of applications we receive, if your budget does not align with these guidelines, we will unfortunately have to decline your application.

An itemized budget means that the budget is broken down into items that each have a quantity, item cost, and total cost.
The items that you list should be specific enough to be purchased. For example, "communications = $300" is not a specific item that could be purchased, so it should be broken down into more specific items such as "1 month data bundle (3) @ $30 = $90" and "cell phones (2) @ $105 each = $210"
Since our grant is small and our grant advisors have to compare hundreds of applications to determine which projects to fund, we cannot accept "miscellaneous," "contingency," or "buffer" costs in the budget.
The costs of your budget items should total the amount of funding you're requesting from TPP (up to $500).
Please list all costs in US dollars.

Please confirm your ability to accept funding.*
I confirm that I have a bank account in my name or my organization's name that can receive grant payments. I confirm my understanding that - with the exception of my fiscal sponsor, if applicable - TPP is unable to make grant payments to any other person or entity on my behalf. I understand that if TPP reviews my proposal and decides to make an offer of funding, that offer is conditional on the ability to accept funds to an account in my name or in my organization's name.
