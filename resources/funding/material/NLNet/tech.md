**Revised Project Pitch: Free-Association**  
**A Protocol for Internet-Scale Mutual Aid & Decentralized Commons**

### **1. Core Alignment with NGI Zero Commons Goals**  
*(Previous sections remain strong; new compute/storage integration added below.)*

### **2. Technical Fit: A Full-Stack Commons for Human Coordination**  
#### **Decentralized Compute & Storage: A Communist Computer for the Commons**  
**Problem**: Centralized cloud providers and blockchain networks lock users into extractive, energy-intensive systems where data/compute allocation follows profit, not collective well-being.  
**Solution**: Free-Association extends its mutual recognition model to **distribute storage/compute capacity** as fluidly as housing or skills, creating a self-optimizing "communist computer":  

1. **Capacity as Mutual Contribution**:  
   - Storage/compute surplus (e.g., idle servers, unused disk space) is shared through the same mutual-recognition algorithms as physical resources.  
   - Your data is replicated and processed **only by nodes with a vested interest in your well-being**—those who directly/indirectly contribute to your self-actualization.  

2. **Antifragile by Design**:  
   - **Data Persistence**: Files are stored across a network of mutual contributors, ensuring redundancy *where it matters most*. Unlike IPFS or blockchain (which replicate indiscriminately), Free-Association prioritizes nodes aligned with your values.  
   - **Process Allocation**: Compute tasks (e.g., AI training, rendering) automatically route to contributors whose surplus capacity is reciprocally tied to your goals.  

3. **Self-Correcting Resource Flow**:  
   - **Healthy Programs Scale**: Codebases that demonstrably contribute to users’ well-being (e.g., privacy tools, climate models) gain compute/storage proportional to their social value.  
   - **Unhealthy Programs Atrophy**: Exploitative or wasteful software (e.g., ads, crypto-miners) lose capacity as mutual recognition decays.  

**Example**:  
> A researcher training an open climate model contributes spare compute to the network. In return, their model automatically runs on nodes belonging to:  
> - Direct collaborators (depth 1),  
> - Environmental activists hosting community datasets (depth 2),  
> - Engineers optimizing renewable energy algorithms (depth 3).  
> The model’s compute allocation grows organically as its social value is recognized—no capital or tokens required.  

**Framing**:  
> *“This is a communist computer: not one that serves the state, but one that serves the commune. Storage and compute become verbs, not commodities—flowing to where they sustain life, not shareholder value.”*

### **3. Why Fund Free-Association?**  
#### **A) Immediate Impact**  
- **Fix critical gaps**: Replace centralized cloud storage with a **values-aligned internet backbone**.  
- **Radical efficiency**: Compute/storage follows actual social need, reducing e-waste (no more idle data centers).  

#### **B) Strategic R&D**  
- **Repartitioning algorithms**: Develop lightweight methods to dynamically reallocate resources as recognition networks evolve.  
- **Security testing**: Ensure data integrity in a network where storage nodes are *curated by mutual interest*, not financial incentives.  

#### **C) Ecosystem Synergy**  
- **Complement NGI priorities**: Integrate with privacy-preserving tools (e.g., federated learning) and green compute initiatives.  
- **Killer app for open hardware**: Raspberry Pi clusters, community mesh networks, and solar-powered servers gain purpose as nodes in a mutual-aid supercomputer.

### **4. Ask: Let’s Build the Internet Commons Together**  
We seek **€50,000** to:  
1. **Extend the protocol**: Add storage/compute capacity types to the mutual recognition engine.  
2. **Build replication/allocator modules**: Develop lightweight libraries for distributed task scheduling and storage.  
3. **Pilot with open projects**: Partner with open-source AI collectives and citizen science networks to stress-test the system.  

**Deliverables**:  
- A **decentralized AWS** where resource allocation follows mutual aid, not market logic.  
- Tools to let any community repurpose old hardware into nodes for the commons.  
- Case studies showing 90% cost reduction vs. corporate cloud providers for aligned projects.

### **Join Us**  
Free-Association isn’t just redistributing resources—it’s redistributing **power over the internet’s infrastructure**. By funding this work, you’re enabling:  
- **A self-healing internet**: Where abusive code starves and collective goods thrive.  
- **A planet-scale mutual aid engine**: Turning every idle device into a brick in the commons.  
- **A post-capitalist cloud**: Where your laptop’s spare cycles help cure diseases, not mine crypto.  

**Let’s rebuild the internet as if people—and the planet—mattered.**

### **Why This Works**  
- **Antibodies for the internet**: Unhealthy programs lose capacity like pathogens rejected by a body.  
- **No more tragedy of the commons**: Resources flow to those who sustain the network, creating a virtuous cycle.  
- **NGI’s missing piece**: A protocol to ethically govern the *physical layer* of the next-gen internet (servers, sensors, devices).
