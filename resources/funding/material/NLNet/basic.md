**Project Pitch: Free-Association**  
**A Protocol for Internet-Scale Mutual Aid & Decentralized Commons**

---

### **1. Core Alignment with NGI Zero Commons Goals**

#### **a) Openness & Decentralization: Infrastructure for Permissionless Collaboration**

**Problem**: Centralized platforms dominate resource coordination, creating silos and dependencies.  
**Solution**: Free-Association is a **peer-to-peer protocol** that operationalizes open-source principles beyond code, enabling decentralized coordination of _social and material resources_.

- **Technical Resonance**:
  - **No central servers**: Runs entirely in browsers via distributed WebRTC/WebAssembly, reclaiming the internet’s public nature.
  - **GitHub-first development**: Fully open-source ([interplaynetary/free-association](https://github.com/interplaynetary/free-association)), inviting scrutiny and permissionless reuse.
  - **Public by design**: Every interaction is transparent, auditable, and user-owned.

**Framing**:

> _“Free-Association is infrastructure for a post-corporate internet—a protocol where collaboration isn’t mediated by platforms, but flows directly between peers. It turns the logic of open-source software into a social operating system.”_

#### **b) Collective Action & Public Ownership: A Digital Public Good for Post-Capitalist Coordination**

**Problem**: Market-driven models fail to align individual incentives with collective flourishing.  
**Solution**: Free-Association replaces extractive ownership with **dynamic mutual recognition**, enabling communities to self-organize resources through:

- **Mathematically enforced reciprocity**: Surplus flows to those who contribute to your self-actualization (and vice versa).
- **Non-ownership economics**: No shares, equity, or tokens—only fluid recognition of real-time contributions.

**Quadruple Helix Alignment**:

- **Civil Society**: Empowers grassroots groups to coordinate housing, food, and skills without bureaucracy.
- **Aligned Businesses**: Enables cooperatives to share surplus capacity (e.g., open-source devs pooling server resources).
- **Academia**: Provides a testbed for post-capitalist economic models and decentralized governance.
- **Public Sector**: Offers a framework for ethical resource distribution in public infrastructure.

**Framing**:

> _“This is collective action as digital public good—a system where communities reclaim ownership of their digital and physical futures through mutual recognition, not monopolies.”_

### **2. Technical Fit: A Full-Stack Commons for Human Coordination**

**Problem**: Internet commons often focus on isolated layers (e.g., protocols _or_ apps), leaving gaps in real-world impact.  
**Solution**: Free-Association bridges the full stack:

| **Layer**       | **Innovation**                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Application** | Browser-based UI for end-users ([live demo](https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association))—no installs, no logins. |
| **Middleware**  | Algorithms for mutual recognition and transitive surplus distribution.                                                   |
| **Protocol**    | Decentralized resource-sharing logic (e.g., housing, code, skills).                                                      |

**Integration Potential**:

- **Open Data Platforms**: Distribute datasets via mutual recognition (e.g., climate researchers sharing surplus compute).
- **P2P Networks**: Integrate with NGI-funded protocols (e.g., federated identity, decentralized storage).
- **Open Hardware**: Coordinate shared manufacturing capacity across fab labs.

**Framing**:

> _“This isn’t just another app—it’s missing infrastructure for the internet commons. By spanning the full stack, Free-Association turns abstract ideals like ‘solidarity’ into executable code.”_

### **3. Why Fund Free-Association?**

#### **A) Immediate Impact**

- **Fix critical gaps**: Current tools for resource coordination (e.g., Slack, Google Sheets) are corporate-owned and siloed.
- **Reduce e-waste**: Surplus-sharing logic optimizes reuse of physical/digital resources (e.g., idle housing, unused servers).

#### **B) Strategic R&D**

- **Scalability testing**: Prove the “six degrees” model for global coordination (currently theoretical).
- **UI/UX democratization**: Simplify complex mutual recognition algorithms into intuitive interfaces.

#### **C) Ecosystem Synergy**

- **Complements NGI priorities**: Integrates with privacy-preserving tools, open hardware, and ethical AI.
- **Fosters quadruple helix collaboration**: Already in dialogue with cooperatives, universities, and open-source collectives.

### **4. Ask: Let’s Build the Internet Commons Together**

We seek **€50,000** to:

1. **Mature the UI/UX**: Transform the prototype into a production-ready tool for grassroots communities.
2. **Optimize algorithms**: Improve efficiency of transitive surplus calculations for large networks.
3. **Document integration pathways**: Create guides for bridging with other commons (e.g., OpenStreetMap, federated networks).

**Deliverables**:

- A hardened, accessible interface for decentralized mutual aid.
- Open APIs for integrating mutual recognition into third-party projects.
- Case studies with housing cooperatives and open-source collectives.

### **Join Us**

Free-Association is more than software—it’s a bid to redefine how humanity coordinates in the digital age. By funding this work, you’re investing in:

- **A post-corporate internet**: Where collaboration flows peer-to-peer, not platform-to-user.
- **A living laboratory**: For ethical resource distribution at planetary scale.
- **A commons-owned future**: Built on open code, mutual recognition, and collective action.

**Let’s reclaim the internet—and our shared future—one mutual connection at a time.**
