For a just and solidarity-based society.

We stand up for indivisible human rights, social justice, and a climate-friendly future. We stand for a diverse, free, and open society. Together we defend our democracy and all who live here against attacks from the extreme right.

We are united by the conviction that every human being has equal dignity.
