Subject: Free Association: Building Systems That Make Philanthropy Obsolete

Dear Leap Team,

We are a rapidly growing diverse Berlin-based network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools for equitable resource distribution. Over three years, we've engaged hundreds globally through "play-labs" - games where communities design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution.

Our work on "Free Association" offers a crucial alternative to capitalist structures by connecting surplus resources through distributed, mutual-recognition networks. As housing shortages, ecological breakdown, and inequality intensify, our work isn't merely theoretical - it's an urgent practical response to converging crises.

Reading Leap's vision, we see deep alignment. Like you, we aim to make extractive systems obsolete, share power radically, and operate with deep transparency. We're both working toward a world "centered on ecological and social wellbeing" where philanthropy itself becomes unnecessary.

We seek funding for a 12-month experiment that would:

- Provide basic monthly stipends for 5 core developers facing housing insecurity
- Establish surplus distribution networks across Berlin neighborhoods
- Host 10 play-labs engaging underrepresented and precarious groups
- Implement free-association in an open-source, p2p interface, available free for all

We'd love to have a conversation about how Free Association might align with Leap's experimental approach to philanthropy!

In solidarity,

[Your Name]
