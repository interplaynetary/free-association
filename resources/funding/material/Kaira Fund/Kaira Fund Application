Describe your idea in max 7 sentences.
Free-Association is a distributed economic model enabling mutual self-actualization through dynamic networks of recognition and surplus sharing. Participants allocate non-transferable recognition to others contributing to their goals, and surplus resources (e.g., housing, skills) are distributed proportionally based on mutual recognition. The system self-corrects via mathematical principles, where false recognition reduces access to genuine contributions. Leveraging six degrees of separation, it connects individuals and organizations globally, ensuring resources flow to where they align with collective values. A browser-based platform facilitates real-time interaction without centralized control. The project aims to replace capitalist hierarchies with scalable, equitable collaboration. By prioritizing reciprocity, it fosters a world where abundance emerges from mutual aid, not exploitation.

Why do you want to realize this idea?
Current systems perpetuate inequality and environmental harm by prioritizing profit over people. Free-Association reimagines resource distribution as a collaborative network, ensuring everyone’s contributions directly enhance collective well-being. We seek to eliminate exploitation, empower marginalized communities, and create resilient, self-correcting economies rooted in trust and shared values.

What is the systemic change you would like to see in the world?
A shift from capitalist/state-controlled economies to decentralized networks where resources flow based on mutual recognition of contributions. Ownership and competition are replaced by dynamic reciprocity, ensuring access to surplus aligns with social and ecological needs. This systemic change fosters equity, reduces waste, and enables individuals and organizations to thrive through interdependence.

How do you want to make your idea or project concrete?
We are developing a browser-based platform where users allocate recognition, declare surplus capacities, and receive shares via algorithmic distribution. Pilots with housing cooperatives and skill-sharing networks will test real-world viability. Ongoing UI/UX improvements, open-source collaboration, and educational resources will onboard users. Future phases will integrate organizational-level sharing and refine governance models.

Is your project scalable? If yes, how could it scale?
Yes. The six-degrees network effect allows exponential growth as participation increases. Decentralized, browser-based technology avoids central servers, enabling global accessibility. Initial organizational-level implementations (e.g., cooperatives sharing energy or housing) demonstrate feasibility, paving the way for individual adoption. Open-source development invites global contributions, accelerating scalability.

If network: what kind of person, expertise or organisation are you looking for?
We seek UI/UX developers, distributed systems engineers, and community organizers experienced in mutual aid. Partnerships with housing cooperatives, NGOs, and academic researchers (economics, sociology) are critical. Legal experts in decentralized governance and economists exploring post-capitalist models would strengthen systemic rigor. Tech collectives and open-source contributors can expand functionality.

If funding: what is the amount you are looking for that could leverage your idea?
€15,000 to finalize the platform’s UI, support core contributors’ basic needs (housing, food), and launch pilot programs. This funding will demonstrate practical impact, attract further investment, and accelerate development.

Can you tell us more about yourself in 7 sentences?
We are a interdisciplinary team of developers, theorists, and activists committed to post-capitalist alternatives. Members have built decentralized tools, facilitated cooperative governance, and organized mutual aid networks. Our prior work includes prototypes validating mutual recognition mechanics and surplus distribution algorithms. We collaborate with academics to ground the model in sociological theory and with grassroots groups to ensure accessibility. Open-source principles guide our work, inviting global participation. Our vision is a world where collective abundance replaces scarcity mindsets. We believe systemic change begins with reimagining how we relate and share resources.

Do you already have partners? If so, describe them and their roles in max 7 sentences.
Open Collective manages transparent fundraising and financial governance. Playnet provides foundational tech infrastructure for decentralized coordination. Academic partners analyze the model’s sociological and economic implications. Housing cooperatives pilot surplus-sharing to refine real-world usability. Volunteer developers contribute to the open-source codebase. A Telegram community of 500+ members offers feedback and testing. NGOs exploring resource distribution models collaborate on integration strategies.

How do you think working together with us can leverage systemic change?
Kaira Fund’s support would amplify visibility, enabling broader adoption of Free-Association as a viable alternative. Funding accelerates platform development and pilots, showcasing tangible success stories. Your network connects us to innovators and policymakers, fostering cross-sector collaboration. Together, we can model how mutual recognition systems replace extractive economies, inspiring global replication.

How did you get to learn about Kaira Fund?
Through recommendations in mutual aid and alternative economy circles. Colleagues highlighted Kaira’s focus on systemic innovation and alignment with our mission to democratize resource access.
