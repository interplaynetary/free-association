Introduction of the Group
We are the Free-Association Collective, a grassroots group based in Berlin, organized non-hierarchically through weekly assemblies where all members participate in consensus-based decision-making. Our 15-member collective includes developers, activists, and community organizers, with roles rotated regularly to ensure equitable leadership. Decisions are made transparently via open forums, prioritizing input from marginalized voices. Rooted in Berlin’s solidarity economy movement, we collaborate with local cooperatives and political initiatives to challenge exploitative systems.

Project Description
Goal: Strengthen Berlin/Brandenburg communities by enabling self-organized resource sharing through a decentralized platform that replaces capitalist hierarchies with mutual recognition networks.

Content:

Platform Development: Finalize a browser-based tool (interplaynetary.github.io/free-association) for dynamically allocating surplus (e.g., housing, skills) based on contributions to collective well-being.

Public Workshops: Host 3 open workshops in Berlin (Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain) to train diverse participants in using the platform.

Outreach Campaign: Launch multilingual flyers and social media campaigns to engage marginalized groups, emphasizing accessibility for refugees, low-income residents, and grassroots collectives.

Implementation:

Partner with Mietshäuser Syndikat (Berlin housing cooperatives) to pilot surplus-housing distribution.

Collaborate with Kritische Wissenschaft Berlin (academic collective) to analyze systemic impacts.

Use open-source code (README.md logic) to ensure transparency and community ownership.

Political & Emancipatory Character:
The project directly challenges capitalist resource hoarding by decentralizing control. It fosters solidarity through algorithmic reciprocity, ensuring surplus flows to those contributing to collective self-actualization. By centering marginalized voices in platform design, it empowers communities to reclaim agency over their material conditions.
