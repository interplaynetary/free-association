## For Cleaning

Scan the entire codebase. We made a lot of really valuable, incremental changes that may have produced code that is now redundant or useless. I want to identify this code and purge it.

I want to keep this codebase as uncluttered as possible so we are focused on removing code that may eventually become a liability.

We will go back and forth meaning that you will change only ONE SPECIFIC THING, then give me time to test functionality and we will continue.

## For Developing
For now we will only to making changes to [NAME OF FILE] and not touching anything else

Make these changes with the minimum amount of code possible, code is a liability, not an asset
