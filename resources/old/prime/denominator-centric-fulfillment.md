# Denominator-Centric Need-Fulfillment Algorithm

## Foundational Equations

### Recognition

```
Your Recognition = 
    your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization

Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Recognition allocated to each contributor:
    Σ Recognition(You, Contributor) = 100%
```

### Mutual Recognition

```
Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = 
    minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition,
            Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)

Properties:
    - Bilateral (requires both parties)
    - Bounded by lesser recognition
    - Range: [0, 1] (as fraction of 100%)
```

### Mutual Desire

```
Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, You) = 
    minimum(Your-Desire-From-Provider,
            Provider-Desire-Into-You)

Properties:
    - Bilateral consent required
    - Both parties must want the relationship
    - Can be unlimited (not capped by capacity)
    - Represents willingness, not actual amount
```

### Need Declaration

```
Recipients declare quantifiable needs:
    Need(Type, Quantity)

Examples:
    Need(money, 500)
    Need(food, 100)
    Need(housing, 1000)
```

---

## How Recognition Flows to Allocation

### The Complete Chain

```
1. Recognition establishes relationships
   You → Them: "I recognize your contribution as X% of my 100%"
   
2. Mutual Recognition defines bilateral strength
   MR(You, Them) = min(Your-Recognition, Their-Recognition)
   
3. Mutual Desire gates willingness
   Both must want the capacity exchange
   
4. Capacity exists at providers
   Provider has Capacity(Type, Quantity)
   
5. Needs exist at recipients
   Recipient declares Need(Type, Quantity)
   
6. Denominator coordinates allocation
   Active-Need = what recipient still needs
   Denominator = Σ [MR × Active-Need]
   Allocation = Capacity × MR × Active-Need / Denominator
   
7. System iterates until equilibrium
   Needs met → Active-Need drops → Denominator shrinks
   → Capacity redirects → Converges
```

### The Flow Diagram

```
Recognition (100%)
    ↓ [bilateral minimum]
Mutual Recognition (MR values)
    ↓ [combined with needs]
Active-Need = Residual-Need × Damping
    ↓ [weighted by MR]
Numerator = MR × Active-Need
    ↓ [sum across recipients]
Denominator = Σ Numerators
    ↓ [proportional division]
Allocation = Capacity × Numerator / Denominator
    ↓ [aggregate from all providers]
Satisfaction → New Residual-Need
    ↓ [iterate until stable]
Equilibrium: Denominators stabilize
```

## Core Insight

The need-fulfillment algorithm is fundamentally about **letting denominators find their equilibrium**. Instead of thinking "we iterate to find allocations," we think: **"we let denominators stabilize as recipients' needs are met."**

---

## The Elegant Reformulation

### Traditional View (Process-Oriented)
```
Round 1: Calculate allocations
Round 2: See over/under-allocation, adjust
Round 3: Adjust again
Round N: Converged
```

### Denominator-Centric View (Structural)
```
The denominator at each provider shrinks as recipients are satisfied.
As it shrinks, capacity automatically concentrates on remaining recipients.
Convergence = when all denominators stabilize.
```

---

## The Formula: Denominator as Primary

### Provider P's Denominator (Dynamic)

```
Denominator(P, round-N) = Σ [MR(P, R) × Active-Need(R, round-N)]
                          for all recipients R

where:
    Active-Need(R, round-N) = 
        min(Mutual-Desire(P, R),
            Residual-Need(R, round-N) × Damping(R, round-N))
```

### Provider P's Allocation

```
Allocation(P → R, round-N) = 
    Capacity(P) × MR(P, R) × Active-Need(R, round-N)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Denominator(P, round-N)
```

### The Magic

**As recipients are satisfied:**
- Their `Residual-Need` decreases
- Their `Active-Need` decreases  
- Provider's `Denominator` shrinks
- **Automatically**, other recipients get more

**No explicit redistribution logic needed** - the denominator does it all!

---

## Round-by-Round Denominator Dynamics

**Note:** This example shows **re-allocation** of the same 300 capacity each round, not cumulative additions. Each round represents a fresh split of P's capacity based on updated residual needs.

### Setup
```
Provider P has Capacity = 300 (fixed - same each round)
Recipients: R1, R2, R3

R1: needs 500, MR(P,R1) = 0.5
R2: needs 300, MR(P,R2) = 0.3  
R3: needs 200, MR(P,R3) = 0.2
```

### Round 1: Initial Denominator

```
Active-Need(R1) = min(500, 500 × 1.0) = 500
Active-Need(R2) = min(300, 300 × 1.0) = 300
Active-Need(R3) = min(200, 200 × 1.0) = 200

Denominator(P, round-1) = (0.5 × 500) + (0.3 × 300) + (0.2 × 200)
                        = 250 + 90 + 40
                        = 380

Allocation(R1) = 300 × (0.5 × 500) / 380 = 197.37
Allocation(R2) = 300 × (0.3 × 300) / 380 = 71.05
Allocation(R3) = 300 × (0.2 × 200) / 380 = 31.58
```

### Round 2: Denominator Shrinks (R3 satisfied)

Suppose R3 was satisfied by other providers. Now:

```
Active-Need(R1) = 500 - 197.37 = 302.63
Active-Need(R2) = 300 - 71.05 = 228.95
Active-Need(R3) = 0  ← SATISFIED!

Denominator(P, round-2) = (0.5 × 302.63) + (0.3 × 228.95) + (0.2 × 0)
                        = 151.32 + 68.69 + 0
                        = 220.01  ← SHRUNK from 380!

Allocation(R1) = 300 × (0.5 × 302.63) / 220.01 = 206.24  ← INCREASED
Allocation(R2) = 300 × (0.3 × 228.95) / 220.01 = 93.76   ← INCREASED
Allocation(R3) = 300 × (0.2 × 0) / 220.01 = 0            ← ZERO

Total: 206.24 + 93.76 = 300 ✓
```

**Notice:** R1 and R2 automatically got more because the denominator shrank!

### Round 3: Denominator Shrinks More

```
Active-Need(R1) = 302.63 - 206.24 = 96.39
Active-Need(R2) = 228.95 - 93.76 = 135.19
Active-Need(R3) = 0

Denominator(P, round-3) = (0.5 × 96.39) + (0.3 × 135.19) + 0
                        = 48.20 + 40.56
                        = 88.76  ← SHRUNK MORE (was 220)

Allocation(R1) = 300 × (0.5 × 96.39) / 88.76 = 162.89
Allocation(R2) = 300 × (0.3 × 135.19) / 88.76 = 137.11
Allocation(R3) = 0

Total: 162.89 + 137.11 = 300 ✓
```

### Convergence: Denominator Stabilizes

When all recipients are satisfied:
```
Denominator(P, round-final) → 0  (or near-zero)
```

Actually, the denominator approaches a stable value where:
- Over-allocated recipients have `Active-Need = 0`
- Under-allocated recipients still have active need
- System is in equilibrium

---

## The Elegant Algorithm: Three Rules

### Rule 1: Recipients Publish Residual Need

```
Residual-Need(R, round-N) = max(0, Stated-Need(R) - Satisfaction(R, round-N-1))
```

This is the **input** to each provider's denominator.

### Rule 2: Provider's Denominator Adjusts

```
Denominator(P, round-N) = Σ [MR(P, R) × Active-Need(R, round-N)]
```

The denominator **automatically** reflects the current state of needs.

### Rule 3: Capacity Flows Proportionally

```
Allocation(P → R) = Capacity(P) × Numerator(P, R) / Denominator(P)

where:
    Numerator(P, R) = MR(P, R) × Active-Need(R)
```

The denominator **enforces** proportional sharing among active needs.

---

## Why This Is More Elegant

### Before (Process View)

```
Algorithm:
1. Calculate allocations
2. Aggregate at recipients
3. Check over/under allocation
4. Adjust next round
5. Repeat until converged

Focus: The adjustment process
```

### After (Denominator View)

```
Algorithm:
1. Recipients publish residual needs
2. Denominators adjust automatically
3. Allocations flow proportionally
4. Repeat until denominators stabilize

Focus: The denominator dynamics
```

### The Key Difference

**Process view:** "We're adjusting allocations based on feedback"

**Denominator view:** "Denominators are seeking equilibrium; allocations are the consequence"

---

## Connection to Physics: Relaxation Dynamics

This is exactly like **relaxation** in physics:

```
Physical System:
    - Springs connecting masses
    - Each spring seeks equilibrium length
    - System relaxes to minimize energy

Need-Fulfillment:
    - Denominators connecting providers/recipients
    - Each denominator seeks equilibrium value
    - System relaxes to satisfy all needs
```

The denominator is the **potential energy** of the system:
- High denominator = high unsatisfied need (high energy)
- Low denominator = needs met (low energy)
- System naturally flows toward low energy state

---

## Convergence Condition: Denominator Stability

### Traditional View
```
Converged when: Over-Allocation < ε AND Under-Allocation < ε
```

### Denominator View
```
Converged when: ΔDenominator(P, round-N) < ε for all providers P

where:
    ΔDenominator = |Denominator(round-N) - Denominator(round-N-1)|
```

**Interpretation:** The system has reached equilibrium when no provider's denominator is changing significantly.

---

## Adaptive Damping as Denominator Stabilizer

### Why Damping?

Denominators can **oscillate**:
```
Round 1: Denom = 400 → Over-allocate
Round 2: Denom = 100 → Under-allocate  
Round 3: Denom = 400 → Over-allocate
```

### Damping Solution

```
Active-Need(R) = min(Mutual-Desire, Residual-Need × Damping-Factor)

If denominator oscillating:
    Damping-Factor = 0.5  (slow down changes)
    
If denominator smoothly decreasing:
    Damping-Factor = 1.0  (full speed)
```

**Effect:** Damping **smooths** the denominator trajectory toward equilibrium.

---

## The Complete Denominator-Centric Algorithm

### Data Structure

```
Provider P maintains:
    - Capacity(P) [fixed]
    - MR(P, R) for each recipient [fixed]
    - Denominator(P) [dynamic - updates each round]

Recipient R maintains:
    - Stated-Need(R) [fixed during convergence]
    - Satisfaction(R) [dynamic]
    - Residual-Need(R) [dynamic]
    - Damping-Factor(R) [dynamic]
```

### Round N Process

**Step 0: Initial State (Round 0)**
```
For each Recipient R:
    Stated-Need(R) = declared need quantity [FIXED during convergence]
    Satisfaction(R) = 0
    Residual-Need(R) = Stated-Need(R)
    Over-Allocation(R) = 0
    Under-Allocation(R) = Stated-Need(R)
    Damping-Factor(R) = 1.0
    Over-Allocation-History(R) = []

For each Provider P:
    Capacity(P) = fixed capacity [FIXED]
    MR(P, R) for each recipient [FIXED]
    Mutual-Desire(P, R) for each recipient [FIXED]
    Denominator(P) = uninitialized
```

**Step 1: Recipient publishes state**
```
For each Recipient R:
    Residual-Need(R) = max(0, Stated-Need(R) - Satisfaction(R))
    
    Publish to public ledger:
        {Residual-Need(R), Damping-Factor(R)}
```

**Step 2: Provider computes denominator**
```
For each Provider P:
    Denominator(P) = 0
    
    For each Recipient R with mutual-desire:
        Active-Need(R) = min(Mutual-Desire(P,R), 
                            Residual-Need(R) × Damping-Factor(R))
        
        Numerator(P,R) = MR(P,R) × Active-Need(R)
        
        Denominator(P) += Numerator(P,R)
```

**Step 3: Provider allocates via denominator**
```
For each Recipient R:
    Allocation(P → R) = Capacity(P) × Numerator(P,R) / Denominator(P)
    
    Send Allocation(P → R) to R
```

**Step 4: Recipient aggregates and updates**
```
For each Recipient R:
    # Aggregate incoming allocations
    Total-Received(R) = Σ Allocation(P → R) from all providers
    
    # Update satisfaction (capped at stated need)
    Satisfaction(R) = min(Stated-Need(R), Total-Received(R))
    
    # Calculate over/under allocation
    Over-Allocation(R) = max(0, Total-Received(R) - Stated-Need(R))
    Under-Allocation(R) = max(0, Stated-Need(R) - Total-Received(R))
    
    # Update damping history
    Over-Allocation-History(R).append(Over-Allocation(R))
    if len(Over-Allocation-History(R)) > 3:
        Over-Allocation-History(R).pop(0)  # Keep only last 3
    
    # Adaptive damping update
    if len(Over-Allocation-History(R)) >= 3:
        recent = Over-Allocation-History(R)[-3:]
        
        # Check for oscillation (up-down-up or down-up-down)
        if (recent[0] < recent[1] > recent[2]) or (recent[0] > recent[1] < recent[2]):
            Damping-Factor(R) = 0.5  # Slow down
        
        # Check for smooth convergence (monotonically decreasing)
        elif all(recent[i] >= recent[i+1] for i in range(2)):
            Damping-Factor(R) = 1.0  # Full speed
        
        else:
            Damping-Factor(R) = 0.8  # Moderate
    
    else:
        Damping-Factor(R) = 1.0  # Default full speed initially
```

**Step 5: Check convergence**
```
Two equivalent ways to check:

Method A: Denominator Stability (denominator-centric view)
    For each Provider P:
        ΔDenom(P) = |Denominator(P,round-N) - Denominator(P,round-N-1)|
    
    If max(ΔDenom) < ε:
        CONVERGED
    
Method B: Recipient Satisfaction (traditional view)
    For each Recipient R:
        Converged(R) = (Over-Allocation(R) < ε AND Under-Allocation(R) < ε)
    
    If all(Converged(R) for all R):
        CONVERGED

Both methods are equivalent. Method A is more elegant (denominator-centric).

If not converged:
    Round N+1: Go to Step 1
```

---

## Properties Through Denominator Lens

### ✅ Conservation

```
Σ Allocation(P → R) = Capacity(P) × Σ Numerator(P,R) / Denominator(P)
                    = Capacity(P) × Denominator(P) / Denominator(P)
                    = Capacity(P) ✓
```

The denominator **enforces** conservation at each provider.

### ✅ Automatic Redistribution

```
When Recipient R1 satisfied:
    Active-Need(R1) → 0
    Numerator(P, R1) → 0
    Denominator(P) shrinks
    
For other recipients R2, R3:
    Their Numerator unchanged
    But Denominator smaller
    → Their Allocation increases automatically
```

The denominator **implements** redistribution.

### ✅ MR-Proportionality

```
Allocation(P → R1) / Allocation(P → R2) = 
    [Capacity × Num(R1) / Denom] / [Capacity × Num(R2) / Denom]
    = Num(R1) / Num(R2)
    = [MR(P,R1) × Active(R1)] / [MR(P,R2) × Active(R2)]
```

If both active needs equal, ratio = `MR(P,R1) / MR(P,R2)`

The denominator **preserves** proportionality.

### ✅ Convergence

```
Each round:
    Needs decrease → Active-needs decrease
    → Numerators decrease → Denominators decrease
    → Allocations redistribute

Eventually:
    All needs met OR all capacity allocated
    → Denominators stabilize → Converged
```

The denominator **drives** convergence.

## Comparison: Before and After

### Original Need-Fulfillment Algorithm

**Focus:** Iterative adjustment of allocations
**Key concepts:** Residual-need, effective-desire, over/under-allocation
**Mental model:** Providers adjusting their decisions based on feedback
**Convergence:** When over/under-allocations are small

### Denominator-Centric Reformulation  

**Focus:** Dynamic evolution of denominators
**Key concepts:** Denominator stability, automatic redistribution
**Mental model:** Denominators seeking equilibrium
**Convergence:** When denominators stop changing

---

## Why This Formulation Is More Elegant

### 1. Unified Principle

**Before:** Multiple mechanisms (residual-need, damping, redistribution)
**After:** One mechanism (denominator dynamics) that naturally produces all behaviors

### 2. Clearer Causality

**Before:** "Allocations adjust → needs met → allocations adjust again"
**After:** "Needs change → denominators adjust → allocations follow"

The denominator is the **causal link** from needs to allocations.

### 3. Connection to Static Case

**Static allocation:** `Allocation = Capacity × Weight / Denominator` (one-pass)
**Dynamic allocation:** Same formula, but denominator updates each round

The **same principle** at different timescales!

### 4. Physical Intuition

Denominators as "system tension" seeking relaxation:
- High denominator = high tension (many active needs)
- Low denominator = low tension (few active needs)
- System naturally relaxes toward equilibrium

### 5. Compositional

The denominator view makes it clear how this fits into multi-level systems:
- Level 1: Static denominator (one-pass)
- Level 2: Dynamic denominator (iterative)
- Level 3: Static denominator (one-pass)

**Same denominator mechanism**, different dynamics.

## Implementation: Denominator-First Design

```python
class Provider:
    def __init__(self, capacity, MR_values):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.MR = MR_values  # MR(P, R) for each recipient
        self.denominator = None  # Current denominator value
        self.numerators = {}  # Numerator(P, R) for each recipient
    
    def compute_denominator(self, recipient_states):
        """The denominator is the primary computation"""
        self.denominator = 0
        self.numerators = {}
        
        for recipient_id, state in recipient_states.items():
            # Active need from recipient state
            active_need = min(
                self.mutual_desire[recipient_id],
                state.residual_need * state.damping_factor
            )
            
            # Numerator for this recipient
            numerator = self.MR[recipient_id] * active_need
            self.numerators[recipient_id] = numerator
            
            # Accumulate denominator
            self.denominator += numerator
    
    def allocate(self):
        """Allocations flow from denominator"""
        allocations = {}
        
        for recipient_id, numerator in self.numerators.items():
            allocations[recipient_id] = (
                self.capacity * numerator / self.denominator
                if self.denominator > 0 else 0
            )
        
        return allocations
    
    def denominator_changed(self, previous_denominator, epsilon=0.01):
        """Check if denominator has stabilized"""
        if previous_denominator is None:
            return True
        return abs(self.denominator - previous_denominator) > epsilon


class ConvergenceCoordinator:
    def run_convergence(self):
        previous_denominators = {}
        
        for round_num in range(max_rounds):
            # Step 1: Providers compute denominators
            for provider in self.providers:
                provider.compute_denominator(recipient_states)
            
            # Step 2: Check denominator stability
            all_stable = all(
                not provider.denominator_changed(
                    previous_denominators.get(provider.id)
                )
                for provider in self.providers
            )
            
            if all_stable:
                return round_num  # Converged!
            
            # Step 3: Allocate based on denominators
            for provider in self.providers:
                allocations = provider.allocate()
                # Send allocations...
            
            # Step 4: Recipients aggregate and update
            # [Recipients update their states...]
            
            # Save denominators for next round
            previous_denominators = {
                p.id: p.denominator for p in self.providers
            }
```

**Notice:** The denominator is computed **first**, then used for allocation. This makes the causal structure explicit.

## Complete Worked Example: All Equations

### Critical Understanding: Re-Allocation vs Accumulation

**Each round represents a RE-ALLOCATION of entire capacity based on CURRENT residual needs, not incremental adjustments.**

```
WRONG interpretation (cumulative):
    Round 1: Provider A gives 285 to R1 → R1 has 285
    Round 2: Provider A gives 370 MORE to R1 → R1 has 285 + 370 = 655

CORRECT interpretation (re-allocation):
    Round 1: Provider A allocates their 400 capacity: 285 to R1, 115 to R2
    Round 2: Provider A RE-allocates their SAME 400 capacity: 370 to R1, 30 to R2
             (The 400 is redistributed based on new information, not added)
```

**Key insight:** 
- Providers don't keep sending more resources each round
- They keep adjusting HOW they split their fixed capacity
- Like tuning knobs until the system reaches equilibrium
- The iteration is about finding the RIGHT allocation, not accumulating allocations

This is why satisfaction in round N depends ONLY on total-received in round N, not sum of all previous rounds.

**Visual analogy:**
```
Provider A has a water tank with 400 liters (capacity)
Two pipes lead to R1 and R2
Each round, A adjusts the valve settings:

Round 1: Valve split: 285 to R1, 115 to R2  (total: 400)
Round 2: Valve split: 370 to R1, 30 to R2   (total: 400)
Round 3: Valve split: 150 to R1, 250 to R2  (total: 400)

The SAME 400 liters flows each round, just redistributed!
Not: 400 + 400 + 400 = 1200 liters cumulative (WRONG)
```

---

### Setup

**Recipients:**
```
R1.Stated-Need = 500
R2.Stated-Need = 300
```

**Providers:**
```
Provider A:
    Capacity(A) = 400
    MR(A, R1) = 0.6
    MR(A, R2) = 0.4
    Mutual-Desire(A, R1) = 500
    Mutual-Desire(A, R2) = 300

Provider B:
    Capacity(B) = 300
    MR(B, R1) = 0.3
    MR(B, R2) = 0.7
    Mutual-Desire(B, R1) = 500
    Mutual-Desire(B, R2) = 300
```

**Recognition context:**
- A recognizes R1 highly (0.6 of A's total recognition)
- A recognizes R2 moderately (0.4 of A's total recognition)
- A's total recognition = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0 = 100% ✓
- B recognizes R2 highly (0.7 of B's total recognition)
- B recognizes R1 moderately (0.3 of B's total recognition)
- B's total recognition = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0 = 100% ✓

### Round 1: Initial Allocations

**Step 1: Recipients publish state**
```
R1.Residual-Need = 500 - 0 = 500
R1.Damping-Factor = 1.0

R2.Residual-Need = 300 - 0 = 300
R2.Damping-Factor = 1.0
```

**Step 2: Provider A computes denominator**
```
For R1:
    Active-Need(R1) = min(Mutual-Desire(A,R1), Residual-Need(R1) × Damping(R1))
                    = min(500, 500 × 1.0)
                    = 500
    Numerator(A,R1) = MR(A,R1) × Active-Need(R1)
                    = 0.6 × 500
                    = 300

For R2:
    Active-Need(R2) = min(300, 300 × 1.0) = 300
    Numerator(A,R2) = 0.4 × 300 = 120

Denominator(A) = 300 + 120 = 420
```

**Step 3: Provider A allocates**
```
Allocation(A → R1) = Capacity(A) × Numerator(A,R1) / Denominator(A)
                   = 400 × 300 / 420
                   = 285.71

Allocation(A → R2) = 400 × 120 / 420
                   = 114.29

Check conservation: 285.71 + 114.29 = 400 ✓
Check MR ratio: 285.71 / 114.29 = 2.5 = 0.6 / 0.4 ✓
```

**Step 2-3: Provider B (parallel)**
```
For R1:
    Active-Need(R1) = 500
    Numerator(B,R1) = 0.3 × 500 = 150

For R2:
    Active-Need(R2) = 300
    Numerator(B,R2) = 0.7 × 300 = 210

Denominator(B) = 150 + 210 = 360

Allocation(B → R1) = 300 × 150 / 360 = 125.00
Allocation(B → R2) = 300 × 210 / 360 = 175.00

Check conservation: 125 + 175 = 300 ✓
Check MR ratio: 125 / 175 = 0.714 = 0.3 / 0.7 ✓
```

**Step 4: Recipients aggregate**
```
R1:
    Total-Received(R1) = 285.71 + 125.00 = 410.71
    Satisfaction(R1) = min(500, 410.71) = 410.71
    Over-Allocation(R1) = max(0, 410.71 - 500) = 0
    Under-Allocation(R1) = max(0, 500 - 410.71) = 89.29
    Over-Allocation-History(R1) = [0]
    Damping-Factor(R1) = 1.0 (only 1 value)

R2:
    Total-Received(R2) = 114.29 + 175.00 = 289.29
    Satisfaction(R2) = 289.29
    Over-Allocation(R2) = 0
    Under-Allocation(R2) = 10.71
    Over-Allocation-History(R2) = [0]
    Damping-Factor(R2) = 1.0
```

**Step 5: Check convergence**
```
Under-Allocation(R1) = 89.29 > ε (NOT CONVERGED)
Under-Allocation(R2) = 10.71 > ε (NOT CONVERGED)

→ Next Round
```

### Round 2: Refinement

**Step 1: Recipients publish updated state**
```
R1.Residual-Need = 500 - 410.71 = 89.29
R1.Damping-Factor = 1.0

R2.Residual-Need = 300 - 289.29 = 10.71
R2.Damping-Factor = 1.0
```

**Step 2: Provider A computes NEW denominator**
```
For R1:
    Active-Need(R1) = min(500, 89.29 × 1.0) = 89.29  ← MUCH SMALLER!
    Numerator(A,R1) = 0.6 × 89.29 = 53.57

For R2:
    Active-Need(R2) = min(300, 10.71 × 1.0) = 10.71  ← MUCH SMALLER!
    Numerator(A,R2) = 0.4 × 10.71 = 4.28

Denominator(A) = 53.57 + 4.28 = 57.85  ← SHRUNK from 420!
```

**Step 3: Provider A allocates (capacity redistributes)**
```
Allocation(A → R1) = 400 × 53.57 / 57.85 = 370.37  ← INCREASED!
Allocation(A → R2) = 400 × 4.28 / 57.85 = 29.63   ← INCREASED!

Check conservation: 370.37 + 29.63 = 400 ✓
Check MR ratio: 370.37 / 29.63 = 12.5 ≠ 1.5

Wait, why isn't the ratio preserved?
Because active-needs are different:
    Ratio = (0.6 × 89.29) / (0.4 × 10.71) = 53.57 / 4.28 = 12.5 ✓

MR ratio preserved relative to ACTIVE needs, not stated needs!
```

**Provider B (parallel)**
```
Numerator(B,R1) = 0.3 × 89.29 = 26.79
Numerator(B,R2) = 0.7 × 10.71 = 7.50

Denominator(B) = 26.79 + 7.50 = 34.29  ← SHRUNK from 360!

Allocation(B → R1) = 300 × 26.79 / 34.29 = 234.39
Allocation(B → R2) = 300 × 7.50 / 34.29 = 65.61

Check conservation: 234.39 + 65.61 = 300 ✓
```

**Step 4: Recipients aggregate**

**REMEMBER:** This round's total-received represents the RE-ALLOCATION (not cumulative addition). See "Critical Understanding" section above.

```
R1:
    Total-Received = 370.37 + 234.39 = 604.76  (sum from both providers THIS round)
    Satisfaction = min(500, 604.76) = 500  ← CAPPED!
    Over-Allocation = 604.76 - 500 = 104.76
    Under-Allocation = 0
    Over-Allocation-History = [0, 104.76]
    Damping-Factor = 1.0 (only 2 values)

R2:
    Total-Received = 29.63 + 65.61 = 95.24  (sum from both providers THIS round)
    Satisfaction = min(300, 95.24) = 95.24
    Over-Allocation = 0
    Under-Allocation = 204.76  ← LARGE under-allocation!
    Over-Allocation-History = [0, 0]
    Damping-Factor = 1.0
```

**What happened?**
- R1's larger residual (89.29 vs 10.71) attracted MORE capacity this round
- Both denominators shrunk dramatically (420→57.85 for A, 360→34.29 for B)
- Capacity concentrated heavily on R1 (who had bigger residual)
- R1 got OVER-allocated (604.76 when only needed 500)
- R2 got UNDER-allocated (95.24 when needed 300)
- System over-corrected! This is why damping and further iteration are needed

**Key insight:** The denominator mechanism automatically redirected capacity toward the larger unmet need (R1), but overshot. Round 3 would correct this by:
1. R1's residual → 0 (satisfied), so denominator drops R1's term
2. R2's residual → 204.76 (large), so denominator increases R2's weight
3. Capacity redistributes back toward R2

### Key Takeaway from Example

This complete walkthrough shows:

1. **Total Recognition = 100%** → MR values sum constraints
2. **Mutual Desire** gates the relationship (bilateral consent)
3. **Active-Need** combines residual need × damping
4. **Denominator** = Σ(MR × Active-Need) - the key coordination variable
5. **Allocation** follows from denominator proportionally
6. **MR ratios preserved** relative to active needs
7. **Conservation enforced** at each provider
8. **Iterations refine** toward equilibrium

For a simpler, complete convergence example, see the earlier section "Round-by-Round Denominator Dynamics".

## Summary

### The Denominator-Centric View Says:

**Need-fulfillment is not about iteratively adjusting allocations.**

**Need-fulfillment is about letting denominators find their equilibrium values.**

### Key Insights

1. **Denominators are dynamic** - they change as needs are met
2. **Convergence = denominator stability** - when they stop changing, we're done
3. **Redistribution is automatic** - shrinking denominators naturally concentrate capacity
4. **Same principle, different timescales** - static vs dynamic denominators
5. **Physical intuition** - denominators as system "tension" seeking relaxation

### The Elegant Reformulation

```
Original: "Iterate allocations until over/under-allocations converge"
Denominator-centric: "Let denominators stabilize to their equilibrium values"
```

**This is more than a reframing - it's a deeper understanding of what the algorithm is actually doing.**

The denominator isn't just a normalization factor - it's the **primary dynamic variable** of the system!
