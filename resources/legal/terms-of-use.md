**Last Updated:** [DATE]  
**Effective Date:** [DATE]

## üîß What This Is (And What It Isn't)

### Protocol vs. Service
- **This is a PROTOCOL**: We have created open-source software code that enables peer-to-peer location sharing and messaging
- **This is NOT a service**: We do not operate servers, host data, or provide centralized services
- **Decentralized by Design**: All data (locations, messages, interactions) flows directly between user devices via GUN.js peer-to-peer protocol
- **No Central Authority**: No single entity controls or manages the distributed network

### Our Role
- **Protocol Developers**: We created the software code/protocol specification
- **Open Source Contributors**: We maintain and distribute free, open-source software
- **NOT Service Providers**: We do not operate, control, or monetize any network or service
- **NOT Data Controllers**: We do not collect, store, process, or control user data

### User Responsibilities as Network Operators
- **You operate your own peer**: By running this software, YOU become a network operator
- **Direct peer-to-peer communication**: Your device communicates directly with other user devices
- **Independent operation**: Each user independently chooses to run the protocol software
- **Self-hosted infrastructure**: Users provide their own devices, internet, and storage

## üìã Software License & Usage Terms

### Open Source License
This protocol software is provided under [LICENSE_TYPE] open source license:
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- No warranties or guarantees
- Use at your own risk
- Source code available at [REPOSITORY_URL]

### Protocol Implementation
- **Experimental Software**: This is beta protocol software under active development
- **No Compatibility Guarantees**: Protocol may change, breaking existing implementations
- **Community Driven**: Development guided by open-source community
- **Fork Friendly**: Anyone may create derivative implementations

### Age & Capacity Requirements
- Must be 18+ or have parental consent to download/use protocol software
- Must comply with local laws regarding software use and data sharing
- Parents/guardians responsible for minors' software usage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical & Legal Disclosures

### How the Protocol Works
- **Direct P2P Communication**: Your device connects directly to other protocol users' devices
- **No Central Servers**: No company servers store or process your data
- **GUN.js Foundation**: Built on established open-source GUN.js peer-to-peer database protocol
- **Voluntary Participation**: Users voluntarily join the distributed network
- **Autonomous Operation**: Each peer operates independently without central coordination
- **Public Data Sharing**: ALL shared data (locations, messages, metadata, interactions) is transmitted and stored publicly without encryption across the peer network

### Data Flow & Storage
- **Peer-to-Peer Only**: Data shared directly between user devices
- **No Service Provider Storage**: We do not store, access, or control any user data
- **User-Controlled**: Each user decides what data to share and with whom
- **Distributed Replication**: Data may replicate to multiple peer devices based on protocol mechanics
- **ALL DATA PUBLIC BY DEFAULT**: Location coordinates, messages, user interactions, and all shared content are transmitted and stored WITHOUT encryption
- **No Privacy Guarantees**: Any data shared through the protocol should be considered permanently public and globally accessible

### What We Do NOT Do
- ‚ùå Operate servers or cloud infrastructure
- ‚ùå Store or process user data
- ‚ùå Monitor network activity
- ‚ùå Control data distribution
- ‚ùå Provide user support or services
- ‚ùå Moderate content or behavior
- ‚ùå Have access to user communications
- ‚ùå Collect analytics or telemetry
