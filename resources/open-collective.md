Here's the equation for deriving the collective distribution pie chart from individual member recognitions:

For a collective with members M = {M₁, M₂, ..., Mₙ}, where each member allocates their 100% recognition to various recipients:

1. First, calculate Mutual Recognition between the collective and each recipient:
   
   For each recipient R:
   ```
   MR(Collective, R) = (1/n) × ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Recognition(Mᵢ, R)
   ```
   Where:
   - n is the number of collective members
   - Recognition(Mᵢ, R) is the recognition percentage member Mᵢ gives to recipient R

2. Then calculate the share of each recipient in the distribution:
   ```
   Share(R) = MR(Collective, R) / ∑ᵣ MR(Collective, r)
   ```
   Where the denominator sums mutual recognition across all recipients.

This produces a normalized pie chart where:
- Each recipient's share is proportional to their average recognition across all members
- The total distribution sums to 100%
- Individual member sovereignty is preserved
- The collective's values emerge from the aggregation of individual recognitions

Each recipient's calculated Share(R) represents their percentage of the funds being distributed.
