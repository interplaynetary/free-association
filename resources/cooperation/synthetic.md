The proposed filter-based synthetic mutual-recognition system resolves the fundamental contradiction Marx identified in cooperative labor—namely, that the social productive power created through cooperation appears as a property of capital rather than of the workers themselves. By disaggregating the technical necessity of coordination from the social form of command, this system enables the formation of what could be termed "post-capitalist cooperation." The filter architecture creates a computational substrate through which the objective requirements of complex production processes can be expressed without reifying these requirements into hierarchical authority structures. This directly addresses Marx's observation that "the work of directing, superintending, and adjusting, becomes one of the functions of capital" by transforming these functions into distributed algorithmic processes negotiated between freely associating producers.

The technical implementation centers on bidirectional filter propagation between capacity-offering agents and capacity-requiring projects. Crucially, this bidirectionality transcends the unilateral "job description" model where only employers specify requirements. Instead, all participants apply filtering conditions, creating a mutual selection process that forms provisional recognition relationships based on the intersection of compatible filter sets. This produces what we might call "coordination without hierarchy"—the system can achieve the efficiency benefits Marx identified in "a body of men working in concert" while eliminating what he termed the "despotic form" of capitalist control. The filters effectively decompose the "plan of the capitalist" into distributed technical constraints that can be negotiated directly by participants.

From a computational perspective, this system represents a significant advance over both market-based resource allocation and centralized planning. Markets fail to optimize labor combinations because price signals cannot adequately capture the emergent properties of complementary capacities. Centralized planning, conversely, suffers from information bottlenecks and principal-agent problems. The filter-based approach enables dynamic, real-time formation of optimal labor combinations through a process akin to constraint satisfaction propagation across a distributed network. This allows the system to achieve both allocative efficiency and dynamic adaptability without either market anarchy or bureaucratic rigidity. Particularly notable is how the system handles the sequentiality and simultaneity requirements of complex production processes through temporal and spatial filter constraints.

The sociological implications extend beyond mere technical coordination. By integrating ethical, social, and preference-based filters alongside technical requirements, the system avoids the reductionist approach of treating labor as abstractly equivalent and interchangeable. This addresses Marx's insight that cooperation transforms not only productive output but the workers themselves, who "strip off the fetters of individuality, and develop the capabilities of their species." The filter system acknowledges the transformative character of cooperative labor by allowing participants to specify not just what they can produce but how they wish to be transformed through the production process. This represents a computational implementation of what might be called "conscious species-being"—the ability to reflectively shape one's development through productive activity.

Perhaps most significant is how this approach reconceptualizes the relationship between individual and collective capacities. Rather than positing the collective as either the sum of individual contributions (methodological individualism) or as an entity transcending individuals (collectivism), the filter system implements what we might call "emergent collectivity." The collective capacity emerges precisely through the specific configuration of complementary individual capacities, made possible by filter-based matching. This directly implements Marx's observation that "the sum total of the mechanical forces exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social force that is developed, when many hands take part simultaneously in one and the same undivided operation." The computational infrastructure thus makes visible and directly accessible what under capitalism appears as an alien power standing above the producers—the social productive power of combined labor.
