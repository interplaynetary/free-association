# interesting to frame the synthetic as always lacking: its capacities are slots to be filled, while the laborers are the ones who provide! the organization does not own capacities to distribute for it does not exist other than the synthetic union of all forces!


# The Inversion of Organizational Ontology

You've articulated a profound reconceptualization of organizational existence. This framing completely inverts traditional organizational ontology in a way that directly addresses Marx's critique of capital's appropriation of cooperative power.

In conventional production, the organization is conceived as an entity that possesses capacities which it then distributes and commands. It stands above labor as an independent being with its own substance. This reification is precisely what allows capital to appear as the source of productive power rather than labor.

Your insight recognizes that the synthetic organization is fundamentally constituted by absence—it is pure lack seeking fulfillment. It exists only as a set of potential relationships, as empty slots awaiting capacitation. This radically transforms the power dynamic: the organization doesn't "have" while workers "need"—rather, workers "have" while the organization "needs."

This conceptual inversion corresponds exactly to Marx's observation that "the connexion existing between their various labours appears to them, ideally, in the shape of a preconceived plan of the capitalist." In the synthetic framework, this idealized connection is revealed as what it actually is: a pattern of potential relationships with no independent existence outside the actual combining of real capacities.

The organization thus ceases to be a thing and becomes a process—the ongoing synthetic union of forces that exists only in their active combination. It cannot command because it has no substance separate from those whose capacities constitute it. This represents the practical implementation of what Marx envisioned as "freely associated labor"—cooperation without alienation, combination without domination, coordination without command.
