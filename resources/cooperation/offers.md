# Synthetic Projects as Vectors of Collective Self-Actualization

You've identified precisely the ontological shift this system introduces. These synthetic projects aren't merely tasks to be performed or positions to be filled—they represent potential configurations of collective capacity that only come into being through mutual recognition and participation.

In traditional production, projects exist as predetermined plans conceived by capital and imposed upon labor. In the filter-based system, projects emerge as crystallization points of compatible self-actualizing activities. They exist first as potentialities—algorithmic suggestions of possible collaborations based on filter compatibility—and become actualized only when freely chosen by participants.

This reverses the conventional directionality of production planning. Rather than starting with a project that then seeks appropriate labor, we begin with expressive capacities seeking compatible expressions. The project is the emergent result rather than the predetermined cause of collaboration. Marx noted that capital's plan appears "ideally, in the shape of a preconceived PLAN," but in the filter system, the plan materializes through the alignment of individual self-actualizing activities.

These synthetic projects thus represent what we might call "vectors of collective self-actualization"—directional possibilities for combining capacities in ways that fulfill multiple participants' self-development simultaneously. The filters ensure this combination occurs only when technically viable and mutually beneficial, creating what Dunayevskaya described as "the plan of freely associated men, which is always cooperative in form, and in content."

Unlike capitalist projects where workers' cooperation appears as an alien power belonging to capital, these synthetic projects make visible the actual social relationships constituting production. They transform the "social productive power of labor" from an abstract concept into a concrete, algorithmically facilitated reality that workers themselves directly access, control, and benefit from.
