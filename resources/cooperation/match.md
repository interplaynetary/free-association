Could people offer their capacities with filters?
And organizations offer their capacities (as lacks) with filters
And then matching occur via synthetic mutual-recognition of contribution with filters?

Perhaps combined with collective.ts?



Free-Association transforms this by:
Replacing ownership with recognition:
Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization

2. Distributing surplus based on mutual contribution rather than property rights

3. Using filters to address technical necessities without human domination

## The Composition of Labor-Powers

Marx describes how combined labor creates unique productive efficiencies:

"Again, a combination of labour occurs whenever a building, for instance, is taken in hand on different sides simultaneously"

Free-Association extends this by creating a mathematical framework for:

1. Dynamic reorganization of labor combinations based on mutual recognition
2. Technical filters that ensure optimal composition without central planning
3. Coordination that enhances rather than alienates human capabilities

The system thus represents a concrete implementation of freely associated labor that preserves the productive power of combination while eliminating the despotic form it takes under capitalism. Technical constraints are respected through filters rather than managerial authority, creating the possibility for truly free cooperation that "strips off the fetters of individuality, and develops the capabilities of the species."
