From Grundrisse:

Labour time itself exists as such only subjectively, only in the form of activity.
In so far as it is exchangeable (itself a commodity) as such, it is defined and
differentiated not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, and is by no means
general, self-equivalent labour time; rather, labour time as subject corresponds
as little to the general labour time which determines exchange values as the
particular commodities and products correspond to it as object.

A. Smith’s thesis, that the worker has to produce a general commodity
alongside his particular commodity, in other words that he has to give a part of
his products the form of money, more generally that he has to convert into
money all that part of his commodity which is to serve not as use value for
himself but as exchange value – this statement means, subjectively expressed,
nothing more than that the worker’s particular labour time cannot be directly
exchanged for every other particular labour time, but rather that this, its
general exchangeability, has first to be mediated, that it has first to take on an
objective form, a form different from itself, in order to attain this general
exchangeability. The labour of the individual looked at in the act of production itself, is the
money with which he directly buys the product, the object of his particular
activity; but it is a particular money, which buys precisely only this specific
product. 

In order to be general money directly, it would have to be not a
particular, but **general labour from the outset**; i.e. it would have to be posited
from the outset **as a link in general production**. 

## But on this presupposition it would not be exchange which gave labour its general character; 
## but rather its presupposed communal character would determine the distribution of products.
## The communal character of production would make the product into a communal, general product from the outset. 
## The exchange which originally takes place in production – which would not be an exchange of exchange values but of activities, determined by communal needs and communal purposes – would from the outset include the participation of the individual in the communal world of products.

On the basis of exchange values, labour is posited as general only through exchange. 

## 	But on this foundation it would be posited as such before exchange; i.e. the exchange of products would in no way
## be the medium by which the participation of the individual in general production is mediated. Mediation must, of course, take place. 

In the first case, which proceeds from the independent production of individuals – no matter how much these independent productions determine and modify each other post festum through their interrelations – mediation takes place through the exchange of commodities, through exchange value and through money; all these are expressions of one and the same relation. 

## In the second case, the *presupposition is itself mediated*; i.e. a communal production, communality, is presupposed as the basis of production. 
## The labour of the individual is posited from the outset as social labour. 
## Thus, whatever the particular material form of the product he creates or helps to create, what he has bought with his labour is not a specific and particular product, but rather a **specific share of the communal production**. 
## He therefore has no particular product to exchange. His product is not an exchange value. 
## The product does not first have to be transposed into a particular form in order to attain a general character for the individual. 
## Instead of a division of labour, such as is necessarily created with the exchange of exchange values, there would take place an organization of labour whose consequence would be the participation of the individual in communal consumption. 

In the first case, the social character of production is posited only post festum with the elevation of products to exchange values and the exchange of these exchange values. 

## In the second case the social character of production is presupposed, and participation in the world of products, in consumption, is not mediated by the exchange of mutually independent labours or products of labour. 

## It is mediated, rather, by the social conditions of production within which the individual is active. 

Those who want to make the labour of the individual directly into money (i.e. his product as well), into
realized exchange value, want therefore to determine that labour directly as
general labour, i.e. to negate precisely the conditions under which it must be
made into money and exchange values, and under which it depends on private
exchange. This demand can be satisfied only under conditions where it can no
longer be raised. Labour on the basis of exchange values presupposes, 
precisely, that neither the labour of the individual nor his product are directly general; 
that the product attains this form only by passing through an objective mediation by means of a form of money distinct from itself.

## On the basis of communal production, the determination of time remains, of
## course, essential. The less time the society requires to produce wheat, cattle
## etc., the more time it wins for other production, material or mental. 

## Just as in the case of an individual, 
## the multiplicity of its development, its enjoyment and its activity 
## depends on economization of time. 

## Economy of time, to this all economy ultimately reduces itself. 

## Society likewise has to distribute its time in a purposeful way, 
## in order to achieve a production adequate to its overall needs;

## just as the individual has to distribute his time correctly 
## in order to achieve knowledge in proper proportions 
## or in order to satisfy the various demands on his activity. 

## Thus, economy of time, along with the planned distribution of labour time 
## among the various branches of production, remains the first economic law
## on the basis of communal production. 
## It becomes law, there, to an even higher degree. 

**However, this is essentially different from a measurement of exchange values (labour or products) by labour time.**

**The labour of individuals in the same branch of work, and the various kinds of work, are different from one another not only quantitatively but also qualitatively.**

## What does a solely quantitative difference between things presuppose?
## The identity of their qualities.
## Hence, the quantitative measure of labours presupposes the equivalence, the identity of their quality.

Ruz: And this quantitative measure need not be labor-time! <but proportions of mutual-validation of mutual-contributions!>
