## SVO (From Master-Slave Dialectics to Mutual-Recognition)

  *In free-association, one does not value apples (objects) but a contributor's provision of apples (subject-verb-object).*

  In stark contrast, in commodity production, one values objects (apples) but not the labor that produced them (the subject-verb-object relation).

  Alienated societies, expropriate the product (object) from the producer (subject-verb) and alienate the producer from the product.

  In capitalism, the capitalist claims to own the surplus-product produced by the subject-verb, and can sell it as a commodity, which leads to *commodity fetishism*.

  By exchanging the objects between eachother, (already alienated from their respective subject-verbs) the commodity fetish takes full hold: **and definite social relations between men themselves, take on - for them - the fantastic form of a social relation between things.**


## Master & Slave
- Master owns the Slave (Subject) their actions (verb) the objects products (object) the means of production (land, tools, etc.) and the means of subsistence (food, housing, etc.)
- 100% of Person is sold as Slave.

## Transition from Slavery to Wage Labor
- Subject becomes formally free, property relations remain unchanged, bourgoise state has formal equality before the law (all subjects are free) but leaves the Object still in the form of private property.
- The Subject is "doubly free" as Marx noted - free to sell labor but also free from means of subsistence (forcing them to sell their labor-power). The Object still takes the form of private property owned by capitalists.
- Worker feels free because they don't sell their lives all at once, but piece by piece, part by part.
- We sell %'s of our life's total-expected labor-power over time.
- The Objects (still taking on the form of private-property of the master) determine the Verb of the Subject

## Mutual-Staking
- Evolution beyond wage labor to equity-based relationships where people sell percentages of their total-equity rather than labor-power directly. This creates bidirectional flows and mutual benefit but still maintains ownership of others.

  *Equity* structures also operate on the basis of proportions of 100%, the sharehoders hold a share in the company.

   Imagine we are each involved in organizations that issue their own shares and distribute dividends (surplus) to their shareholders.

   Mutual-Stakeholding [(ECSA)](ecsa.io): Imagine several such organization swapping shares with each other, now dividends are flowing bidirectionally through the network.

   We are risking-together and benefiting-together.

   In Mutual-Stakeholding, we have entered a non-zero-sum economic relationship, in which we each gain by increasing the well-being of all others.

   All of these desirable properties of Mutual-Stakeholding are inherited in Free-Association, but with a **crucial** difference.

  In equity you *own* a share of me.

  You may deploy any duplicitous means to gain my recognition of your contribution towards my self-fulfillment, you could lie to me with no end! And so long as you have secured your shares: you *own* my recognition.

  In other words, in Mutual-Stakeholding: the **Past dominates the Present**. I can not remove my recognition of the past that is no longer true, because you own it. 
  
  **The transferability of recognition in the form of objects/tokens/money - is the condition of possibility of the accumulation of recognition in general and is the condition of possibility of false-recognition that persists even in the light of new information in the Present.**

  On the contrary, in Free-Association: **The Present reigns over the Past**. I am able to, at a whim, modify my recognition of the Past in the light of new information in the Present.
  
  In Free-Association I can *re-attribute* shares of my total-recognition - also proportions of 100% - and **this is only possible because in Free-Association we each own 100% of ourselves!**

  *We are free! You don't own me, and I don't own you! We owe each other nothing!*

  Recall that Mutual-Recognition is Hegel's resolution of the master-slave dialectic.

## From Mutual-Staking to Free-Association
- Subject, Verb, and Object are free!
- Liberating the Subject by ensuring each person owns 100% of themselves rather than being owned in parts by others through equity
- Liberating the Verb (productive activity) by reconnecting it with conscious intention and mutual recognition rather than alienated labor
- Liberating the Object by transforming it from private property into freely flowing surplus distributed according to mutual recognition

"We present a formulation of a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other without any centralized control, planning, private-property or state intervention!"
"In Free-Association: The Present reigns over the Past. I am able to, at a whim, modify my recognition of the Past in the light of new information in the Present."
"In Free-Association I can re-attribute shares of my total-recognition - also proportions of 100% - and this is only possible because in Free-Association we each own 100% of ourselves!"
"We are free! You don't own me, and I don't own you! We owe each other nothing!"
"Mutual-Recognition is Hegel's resolution of the master-slave dialectic."
