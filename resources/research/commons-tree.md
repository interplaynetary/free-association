# Commons Tree

Our commons-tree is has a root representing the whole of socially-necessary-production.
Each branch of the tree is a particular branch of production.

The tree is a composition of labor and labor required to provision definite quantities of useful-objects as means-of-production from the social-stock.

(compositions of labor/means of production)

The proportions in the tree represents the the proportion of total-social-labour that are required to (re)produce:
- composed-labor 
- the appearence of useful-objects in a production-process: this is the social-labor-required to provision those definite quantities of useful objects for use in the act of production when they are needed! (Means of Production, held in common! These objects come that portion of the social-stock that serves as fresh-means-of-production)

Our communal stock-book (inventory) consists of definite quantities of objects of utility that belong to us.

The total product of our community is a social product. 
- One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social. 
    - This is a stock of objects which can be used to provision the use of those definite quantities of useful objects for use in the act of production when they are needed (think of it like a object-library+delivery-service)
- But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence. 
        A distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary. 
        The mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of historical development attained by the producers. 
    - Let us assume, that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his shareOfCommonsProduction. 
    
    shareOfCommonsProduction:
        - As a recursive proportion of the particular part of a particular branch:
            - Each node's share is its proportion of its parent's share
            - This creates a chain of proportions from leaf to root
            - Individual labor becomes part of composed labor
            - Composed labor itself becomes part of larger compositions
            - Until we reach the total social labor at the root
            - Thus each share is simultaneously:
                - A part of its immediate parent branch
                - A part of the whole social product      
        - This recursive proportion would then play a double part:
            - Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan (which is the commons-tree itsef) maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. 
            - On the other hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption. 

All the relations between Society and the objects that form this wealth of our own creation, are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion.

And yet those relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value.

The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution.

The labour power of each individual, by its very nature, operates in this case merely  as a definite portion of the whole labour power of society, 
and therefore, the measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration, appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour.

Let us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common, 
in which the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community.
