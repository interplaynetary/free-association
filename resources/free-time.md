The question of time allocation in free association represents a fundamental break from the alienated time-keeping of capitalist production. When we ask "how do you spend your time?", we are not seeking to impose external metrics or standardized units of measurement, but rather to understand the living, breathing process of human self-actualization through mutual contribution.

In free association, we recognize not abstract labor-time, but concrete contributions to each other's self-actualization. When I say that you occupy 30% of my recognition, I am not measuring discrete units of your time, but rather acknowledging how your living activity - in all its rich particularity - has contributed to my own development as a social being.

This recognition of time-as-contribution liberates us from the tyranny of the clock. No longer must we fragment our lives into standardized working hours, selling our time as a commodity. Instead, we can understand time through the lens of mutual fulfillment - how our activities interweave to create the conditions for each other's flourishing.

The proportional nature of recognition in free association (totaling to 100%) reflects not an arbitrary mathematical constraint, but the finite nature of human attention and energy. We cannot infinitely expand our capacity for meaningful engagement. Yet within these natural limits, we can consciously direct our recognition toward those activities and relationships that genuinely contribute to collective self-actualization.

Crucially, as the README emphasizes, this system requires no centralized ledger of contributions, no universal standard of measurement. Each person's recognition of how others' time-activities contribute to their development remains particular to their concrete situation and needs. The social validity of contributions emerges through mutual recognition rather than conformity to external definitions.

This transforms the very meaning of "time allocation." Rather than parceling out predetermined units, we are really asking: how do your living activities contribute to the self-actualization of others? How do others' activities contribute to yours? The proportions express not quantities of abstract time, but qualities of mutual fulfillment.

Consider how different this is from capitalist time-management, where we must constantly account for our hours to prove our productivity to external authorities. In free association, we account to each other directly through our mutual recognition of real contributions. The "efficiency" of time use is measured not by abstract metrics but by concrete human development.

This also transforms our relationship to "leisure time." The false opposition between work time and free time dissolves when all activity is understood through its contribution to mutual self-actualization. Reading a book that helps you better support your community is no less valuable than traditional "productive" labor. The question becomes not "is this work or leisure?" but "how does this activity contribute to our collective flourishing?"

The prompts about priorities and values take on new meaning in this context. They ask not how we should divide abstract time units, but how we wish to direct our living energy toward different aspects of human development. The proportions express not rigid quotas but flowing patterns of mutual contribution.

In essence, free association allows us to reclaim time as a dimension of human self-actualization rather than an external constraint. We move from "spending time" as if it were money to "contributing time" as an expression of our social nature. This is not mere philosophical reframing - it represents a practical transformation in how we organize our collective activity toward universal human emancipation.
