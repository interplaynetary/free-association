Excellent and crucial additions. Your implementation notes correctly identify the primary challenges in moving from a formal theoretical grammar to a working computational system. These are the exact hurdles computational linguists and NLP engineers face when operationalizing such frameworks.

Let's expand on these notes with specific technical considerations and potential solutions.

### **Expanded Implementation Notes for a Computational SVO Lens**

#### **1. Parsing and Coreference Resolution**

*   **Challenge:** The grammar requires clean `<S> <V> <O>` triples as input. Real-world text is messy, with pronouns, ellipsis, and complex sentence structures.
*   **Solution:** Utilize a modern NLP pipeline.
    *   **Tooling:** The **SpaCy** library is ideal for this task. Its pipeline includes:
        *   **Dependency Parsing:** To identify the subject, root verb, and object of a clause. This is more reliable than simple pattern matching for finding SVO relationships.
        *   **Coreference Resolution:** To resolve what "it", "this", "they", etc., refer to (e.g., linking "this property" back to "intellectual property"). SpaCy's experimental coreference resolution or more powerful libraries like **AllenNLP**'s coref model can be integrated.
    *   **Process:** The text would first be run through this pipeline to produce a list of resolved, canonical SVO propositions before the alienation grammar rules are applied.

#### **2. Morphological Analysis & Reification Lexicon**

*   **Challenge:** Automatically detecting that a noun like "building" is a reification of the verb "to build".
*   **Solution:** A multi-layered approach.
    *   **Morphological Analysis:** Use a lemmatizer (built into SpaCy) to find the root form of a word. `"building"` (noun) and `"building"` (verb) have the same lemma: `"build"`.
    *   **Reification Lexicon:** Create a dedicated list of common reified nouns and map them to their verbal forms. This is necessary because not all nominalizations are morphologically obvious (e.g., "labor" from "to work", "service" from "to serve").
        *   `{"labor": "work", "service": "serve", "property": "own", "design": "design", "software": "develop"}`
    *   **Contextual Clues:** The grammar itself provides the clue. If a word is in the `<O>` slot and is also the lemma of a verb, it's a candidate for reification, especially if it's later governed by another subject.

#### **3. Discourse Analysis and Logical Connectivity**

*   **Challenge:** Determining that two separate sentences ("The worker builds the furniture. The company owns the furniture.") are logically connected to form an `<Alienated-Relation>`.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Co-reference (as above):** Is crucial for linking `the furniture` and `it`.
    *   **Discourse Connectives:** Look for explicit cues like "then", "therefore", "so", "because", which signal a logical connection.
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Use word embeddings or sentence transformers (e.g., **Sentence-BERT**) to calculate the semantic similarity between the object of the first proposition and the object being governed in the second. A high similarity score would indicate they are likely the same entity, justifying the connection.

#### **4. Disambiguating Alienating vs. Non-Alienating Passives**

*   **Challenge:** This is the most context-dependent and subtle task. Not all passives are alienating.
*   **Solution: A Rule-Based Classifier within the Grammar.**
    *   **Rule 1: Check for the presence of a "by" phrase.**
        *   If the passive construction includes an explicit agent (`[by] <S>`), analyze that agent.
        *   **Alienating:** If the agent is a distinct class or entity that governs/owns (e.g., `"...is owned by the company"`).
        *   **Non-Alienating:** If the agent is a collective or the original actor themselves (e.g., `"...was agreed upon by the community"`, `"...was created by the artist for herself"`).
    *   **Rule 2: If the "by" phrase is omitted, infer the agent from context.**
        *   This is harder. The system might need to use a knowledge graph or common-sense reasoning. For example, in "Profit is extracted," the omitted agent is almost always a capital-owning class, making it alienating.
    *   **Rule 3: The "Beneficiary" Test.**
        *   The structure `"<O> is <V-ed> for <S2>"` (e.g., "The report was written **for the manager**") is often a marker of a hierarchical relationship and can be tagged as potentially alienating.

### **Proposed System Architecture**

A practical implementation would look like this:

1.  **Input Text Pre-processing:** Tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging (SpaCy).
2.  **Core Proposition Extraction:** Dependency parsing to extract SVO triples and coreference resolution to resolve pronouns (SpaCy + AllenNLP).
3.  **Discourse Analysis:** Connect propositions across sentences using connectives and semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT).
4.  **Alienation Pattern Matching:** Apply the **Rule Set A** grammar to the connected graph of propositions. This step uses the reification lexicon and the rules for classifying passives.
5.  **Transformation:** For any matched `<Alienated-Relation>` pattern, apply the corresponding substitution rule from **Rule Set C**.
6.  **Output Generation:** Render the transformed propositions into fluent language. This could be a simple template fill or a more advanced step involving a final natural language generation pass.

Your implementation notes are not just footnotes; they are the blueprint for building the parser. They correctly frame this as an NLP problem, moving the project from a brilliant theoretical formulation into the realm of a viable software tool.
