# Playlab: Activating Mutual Aid Through Recognition-Powered Capacity/Resource Sharing

// refine the initial prompt: not all features ready, allow users to take notes of features/concepts they find lacking in the interface at key moments

## Playlab Overview

**Duration (total time):** 90 minutes
**Goal:** Enable participants to understand and actively use recognition-based capacity/resource sharing for community building

**Roles:**

**Tools:**

- Jitsi: free, supports 50-100 participants, with breakout rooms
- TlDraw: free, collaborative digital canvas

## Playlab Structure

### Phase 1: Foundations & Self-Awareness (25% of total time)

#### A. Empathy Building (15%)

1. **Perspective Walks in Trios**
   - Share personal experiences:
     - "One daily struggle rooted in my identity/location"
     - "One dream for my neighborhood"
   - Example Sharing:
     - Struggle: "As a migrant parent, fear of deportation limits my community participation"
     - Dream: "Multilingual playground where all cultures feel welcome"

2. **Common Ground Mapping**
   - Groups collaborate on digital canvas
   - Visually connect overlapping struggles and dreams
   - Identify shared community patterns

#### B. Platform Introduction (10%)

- Introduction to https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association
- Profile creation and basic navigation

### Phase 2: Tool & Concept Mastery (35% of total time)

#### A. Interface Familiarization

1. **Personal Profile Setup**
   - Define personal/community needs
   - Articulate core values/priorities (e.g., "safe public spaces," "skill-sharing hub")
   - Create "My Inventory" catalog:
     - Material resources (e.g., "10 folding chairs")
     - Skills (e.g., "graphic design skills")
     - Access rights (e.g., "community center access")

2. **Recognition System Understanding**
   - Live demonstrations of:
     - Mutual recognition mechanics: _"When we both allocate >0% to each other, our capacities become offered to one another"_
     - Inventory visibility rules
     - Minimum recognition principle with examples:
       _"If I give you 50%, you give me 10% → mutual-recognition = 10%"_
       _"If we have 10% of mutual-recognition and you are my only mutual-relationship, you would have 100% of my total-mutual-recognition (10%/10% = 100%)."_
       _"If I have two mutual-relationships each with 10% mutual-recognition, each would have 50% of my total-mutual-recognition (10%/20% = 50%)."_
     - Priority-based distribution effects

#### B. Dynamic Capacity Distribution

- Interactive examples showing:
  - How changing priorities affects capacity distribution
  - Real-world scenarios:
    - "Increasing 'experimentation' priority → hackathon environment"
    - "Shifting to 'community gathering' priority → festival space"
  - Detailed example: "If I increase the priority of 'experimentation', those who I recognize as contributing to experimentation get more access to my housing-capacity. Within the limits of mutual-recognition, I likely get more access to their capacities related to experimentation (e.g., whiteboards, markers, etc.). Next thing you know my house is now a hackathon! If I change my priority to cuddles, then my house becomes a festival."

### Phase 3: Community Action Design (25% of total time)

#### A. Issue Clustering (10%)

1. **Group Formation**
   - Organize around shared concerns
   - Example clusters:
     - Food Justice (8 members)
     - Neighborhood Safety (5 members)

#### B. Capacity Mapping (15%)

1. **Breakout Sessions**
   - Form topic-specific groups
   - Inter-group movement encouraged (freely associate between groups)
   - Participants can move between groups as interests evolve

2. **Individual Sharing Rounds**
   - Share platform username/alias (so others can identify you)
   - Declare topic-specific values/priorities
   - List relevant capacities
   - While others are speaking, actively recognize those (including yourself) who contribute to your values in the interface

3. **Recognition Practice**
   - Real-time recognition attribution
   - Mutual offer exploration within your interface
   - Capacity composition exercises
     - Building gift-economy based supply chains while maintaining mutual-recognition proportions
     - Example: A capacity to "cook food for the hungry" might desire ingredients from a capacity to "gather surplus food from grocery stores", which then composes into a capacity to "organize city-wide food distribution"

### Phase 4: Implementation & Commitment (15% of total time)

#### A. Action Planning (5%)

- Capacity-Composition (Desire-Expression)
- Capacity filter configuration

#### B. Recognition Calibration (5%)

- Priority adjustment based on discoveries
  - Feel into relative priorities and adjust recognition percentages
  - Real example: "Increased priority of festival-organization to 25% after accessing Kai's event equipment"

#### C. Commitment Setting (5%)

- Concrete action planning
- Timeline establishment
- Capacity coordination
- Specific commitments using combined capacities
  - Example: "We'll host the first cooking class using Maria's kitchen + Tom's meal boxes next week"

### Phase 5: Reflection and Refinement (X% of total time)

- Gather ideas for how to improve playlab
- Opening up Github Issues
- Refining milestones

## Expected Outcomes

Participants will leave with:

1. Configured platform profiles with defined capacities
2. 3-5 established mutual recognition relationships
3. 1-2 initiated community projects
4. Practical understanding of recognition-powered capacity sharing

## Notes for Facilitators

- Ensure balanced time management between sections
- Encourage active participation in all exercises
- Provide technical support during platform interaction
- Foster organic connection-building between participants
