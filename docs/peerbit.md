// we should make clear


so my thinking goes like this:

1. storage/compute capacity (like any other capacity) get distributed according to mutual-contribution
2. this means your data replciated/persisted across the network at exactly those parts of the network topology that have a vested interest in your well-being (they are direct/indirect mutual-contributors) these are likely the most efficient and antifragile places your data could be replicated and processes run
3. free-association becomes a distributed constantly repartitioning communist computer, where data/processes can scale with your transitive-mutual-contribution, rather than fixed allotments of computation that we would buy or sell, here we would just contribute surplus compute/storage capacity into our networkand end up supporting (at a computational level) those programs that contribute to our aliveness

this means that unhealthy digital programs (ones that dont contribute to our aliveness) would decrease over time in their storage/compute capacity, and healthy ones would scale healthily.

üîó What You're Proposing (in distilled form)
You're conceptualizing a decentralized, dynamically adaptive computation+storage mesh where:
Data & code live where they're valued most, by mutual contribution.

Folders/files form tree hierarchies, modeled as graph/forest structures.

Replication follows social, temporal, or hash-based logic, adapting to the health or vitality of the data/app.

‚ÄúUnhealthy‚Äù or inactive programs decay, freeing capacity. Healthy systems scale automatically by mutualist reinforcement.

It's not capitalism: allocation isn‚Äôt based on fiat/price, but on mutual-recogintion of mutual-contribution (which may take the form of computation/storage, but is not limited to this).

A communist computer, to borrow your term, that routes capacity to aliveness.

üîÅ Example Flow: Mutualist File
Imagine a .narrative.md file authored by you:
You contribute resources to the network ‚Üí other‚Äôs recognize your contribution to their "aliveness"

Your file is replicated to nearby contributors who mutually-benefit from each other
As your contribution aids others, your direct/indirect mutual-contribution grows

The file stays alive in the system, replicated widely

‚ú® What Peerbit Unlocks Here
Peerbit is incredibly exciting because it enables modular, programmable, live-updating replication logic:
Replication is driven by data context ‚Äî you choose what properties (time, identity, utility score) influence placement

Unlike IPFS which is static, Peerbit lets replication evolve over time

Ideal for your model where value = contribution over time

Yes ‚Äî Peerbit is extremely well-suited for the kind of dynamic repartitioning you described. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the only protocols in the decentralized space that explicitly enables live, programmable replication domains ‚Äî a foundational requirement for what you‚Äôre building.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown showing how Peerbit supports your vision, point-by-point:

‚úÖ Your Idea: Dynamic Repartitioning Based on Mutual Contribution
‚ÄúData persists where it has mutualist value ‚Äî and decays otherwise.‚Äù
üîß How Peerbit Enables This:
Peerbit lets you define custom replication domains using any property (e.g., timestamp, hash, author ID, contribution score).

You can dynamically project data onto a [0, 1] range, which can change over time (e.g., as mutualism changes).

Replication ranges can shift continuously ‚Äî data is only stored by nodes in the matching sub-range.

You can use logic like:

domain: createDocumentDomain({
fromValue: (value) => contributionScore(value.author),
...
})

So, if someone‚Äôs contribution score drops, their data can automatically fall outside the active replication window and get pruned over time.

‚úÖ Your Idea: Programs That Scale or Shrink With Their Utility
‚ÄúHealthy code/data scales; unhealthy decays.‚Äù
üîß How Peerbit Enables This:
Data in Peerbit isn't pinned forever ‚Äî it only stays replicated if:

It remains within the active replication domain

Enough peers choose to replicate it (incentivized by contribution)

You can link replication ranges to live scores, like mutual value, usage count, or peer-reinforcement.

Programs (code) are data ‚Äî they follow the same rules.

The system becomes self-healing and adaptive, like a living organism pruning dead tissue.

‚úÖ Your Idea: A Continuously Evolving Mesh
‚ÄúConstant repartitioning across the network topology.‚Äù
üîß How Peerbit Enables This:
Unlike traditional DHTs (which are static and hashed), Peerbit‚Äôs domains can move based on real-world context.

Peers subscribe to segments of the domain and update their subscriptions over time.

You can implement logic like:

Follow authors with similar interests

Track time windows of most relevance

Monitor transitive mutual contributors and only replicate their data

The result is a fluid, emergent, topology-aware network, driven by meaning, not randomness.

üìå In Summary
Peerbit absolutely can do the kind of dynamic, mutualist-based repartitioning you envision. It is:
Built for live, programmable replication domains

Designed to allow content-driven partitioning

Fully extensible to reflect social, temporal, identity, or utility logic

Would you like a custom code example showing how to build a Peerbit domain based on a live ‚Äúmutual contribution score‚Äù?

Mapping the Future of Replication: Custom Data Domains in Peerbit
Imagine a system where data replication isn‚Äôt fixed but is dynamically mapped to a continuous space. With Peerbit‚Äôs custom data domains, you can define replication ranges that flexibly reflect properties of your data‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a hash, a timestamp, or even the buffering timeline of a live video stream.
A Generalized Address Space
Traditional replication methods rely on fixed partitions or discrete addressing. In contrast, range-based replication projects content onto a 1-dimensional line bounded by [0, 1]. This continuous space can represent any property you choose:
Hash Mapping:
Convert a document‚Äôs hash into a number within [0, 1], effectively turning your system into a DHT-like network.
Time Mapping:
Map timestamps so that 1 represents the present and 0 the earliest time. This is ideal for chronological data such as logs or video segments.
Identity Mapping:
Use data such as author identity to group documents, enabling replication strategies that prioritize content from specific creators.
For example, subscribing to a live feed might involve replicating only the latest segment (e.g., [0.999, 1]). As the stream evolves, the replication range shifts dynamically. Or when you are buffering a video, then you will replicate the segments that are being buffered and continously expand the replication range as the video progresses. See the video below
The timeline will turn more blue and become taller when more replicators/viewers are watching the video.

Domain Mapping Strategies: Hash vs Time vs Identity
When designing a custom data domain, the choice of mapping strategy is crucial. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the benefits and trade-offs of three common approaches:
Hash-Based Domains
Benefits:
Determinism:
A hash consistently maps the same input to the same output, ensuring predictable data placement.
Uniform Distribution:
Cryptographic hashes distribute data evenly across the [0, 1] space.
Cons:
Lack of Context:
Hashes do not convey temporal or author-related context, making it harder to group data created closely in time or by the same author.
Replication Granularity:
Data can be scattered, which may complicate localized replication.
Time-Based Domains
Benefits:
Temporal Grouping:
Data is naturally ordered by time, making it ideal for logs, streams, or any time-sensitive content.
Real-Time Efficiency:
Applications like live feeds can focus replication on the most current data.
Cons:
Constant Evolution:
As time advances, the mapping shifts continuously, which may require frequent adjustments.
Clustering Risks:
High-activity periods may result in many items falling into a small segment of time, leading to imbalanced replication.
Identity-Based Domains
Benefits:
Author-Centric Grouping:
Data can be grouped by creator, allowing targeted replication strategies.
Enhanced Filtering:
Enables replication or moderation based on the source of the content.
Cons:
Scalability Issues:
A prolific author might dominate a segment of the space, potentially overloading that segment.
Temporal Ambiguity:
Identity mapping does not inherently order data chronologically.

Practical Example: Creating a Time-Based Domain
Below is an example of how you might create a custom replication domain for a time property in a document. In this example, the domain maps a timestamp property into the [0, 1] range, allowing you to replicate data based on when it was created.
import { Program } from "@peerbit/program";
import { Documents, createDocumentDomain } from "@peerbit/document-store";
import { field } from "@dao-xyz/borsh";
import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

class Document {
@field({ type: "string" })
id: string;

@field({ type: "u32" })
timestamp: number; // Represents the time property

constructor({ id, timestamp }: { id?: string; timestamp: number }) {
this.id = id || uuid();
this.timestamp = timestamp;
}
}

@variant("time-based-store")
class TimeBasedStore extends Program {
@field({ type: Documents })
docs: Documents<Document, Document>;

constructor(docs?: Documents<Document, Document>) {
super();
this.docs = docs || new Documents<Document, Document>();
}

async open(options?: any): Promise<void> {
await this.docs.open({
// The domain is created based on the 'timestamp' property.
domain: createDocumentDomain({
// resolution, u32 or u64
resolution: "u32",

        // whether a search request should project all results to one replication range
        canProjectToOneSegment: (request) => true,

        // from document to coordinate space [0, max U32]
        fromValue(value) {
          return value?.time ?? 0
        },
      }),
      type: Document,
      ...options,
    });

}
}

In this code:
Document Class:
The document is defined with a timestamp property that represents its creation time.
TimeBasedStore Class:
The store uses a custom domain where the timestamp property is mapped into the replication space. The open method initializes the document store with this domain, ensuring that documents are replicated based on their time property.
Bringing It All Together
Peerbit‚Äôs custom data domains represent a paradigm shift in replication:
Flexibility:
Map any property‚Äîhash, time, or identity‚Äîinto a continuous space, adapting replication to your application‚Äôs needs.
Efficiency:
Dynamic adjustment of replication ranges minimizes rebalancing overhead and improves data availability.
Real-World Utility:
Whether you‚Äôre building a decentralized document store or a live video stream, the ability to tailor replication based on content properties leads to more efficient and targeted data distribution.
Watch the upcoming video demonstration where the buffering timeline of a live video translates directly into the replication domain. As the video buffers, new segments are dynamically replicated, ensuring a seamless, real-time experience.
