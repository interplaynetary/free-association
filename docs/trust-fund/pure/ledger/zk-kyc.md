Nice — this is a rich, doable problem. Below I’ll explain **how zero-knowledge (ZK) compliance proofs work in practice**, how to **automate AML/KYC** in your Verein model, and give a **concrete implementation blueprint + recommended stack** you can follow (including privacy, revocation, auditability, and where the Board stays out of the loop). I’ll be concrete about trade-offs and legal cautions for Switzerland.

# 1) High level idea (one-line)

Have a **regulated KYC provider** (attestor) verify identities off-chain and issue **verifiable credentials**. Members hold those credentials in their wallets and produce **zero-knowledge proofs** (ZKPs) that they satisfy required attributes (e.g., “KYC passed”, “not on sanctions list”, jurisdiction OK) — proofs that the protocol and the Board can verify **without learning personal data**. The Board only receives the verification result and cryptographic receipts (not raw identity data).

Key research & industry work shows this pattern (SSI + ZK proofs + policy enforcement). ([arXiv][1])

---

# 2) Core components (short list)

1. **Trusted KYC/Attestor** — a regulated service (or internal compliance team) that performs full KYC/AML and issues a signed credential.
2. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) wallet** — stores credentials locally for the user (mobile/browser).
3. **Verifiable Credential (VC)** — W3C-style credential with attributes (e.g., country, risk score, KYC status).
4. **ZK circuit / proving system** — a circuit that takes the VC (or a hash/commitment of it) and creates a ZK proof of required predicates (e.g., passed KYC, risk ≤ threshold, not-on-sanctions). Common primitives: zk-SNARK (Groth16, PLONK), zk-STARK, Halo2.
5. **On-chain/off-chain verifier (oracle)** — verifies ZK proofs and attestor signatures and emits a lightweight verification token the protocol reads.
6. **Revocation / freshness mechanism** — proves credential hasn’t been revoked (revocation accumulator, short-lived credentials, or freshness nonces).
7. **Audit escrow (optional)** — encrypted identity records retained by attestor + auditor-key access (for regulators under warrant).

Important: Swiss law requires regulated customer identification when handling certain services; ZK proofs can preserve privacy but you still need a regulated attestor and auditable chain for regulators. See Swiss AML guidance. ([swissamf.com][2])

# 3) How the ZK-KYC flow looks (step-by-step)

1. **KYC & credential issuance (off-chain)**

   * User completes full KYC with a *regulated* attestor (could be a crypto custodian, regulated fintech, or third-party KYC provider).
   * Attestor verifies identity (ID docs, PoA, sanctions screening) and issues a **Verifiable Credential (VC)** containing attributes needed for your rules (e.g., `kyc_pass=true`, `country=CH`, `risk_score=12`). The credential is signed by the attestor.

2. **User holds credential in wallet**

   * The VC is stored locally in the user’s SSI wallet (mobile/extension). The wallet can derive commitment(s) or attribute encodings suitable for ZK circuits.

3. **User creates a ZK proof of compliance**

   * The user’s wallet constructs a ZK proof that: (a) the signed VC exists and is validly signed by a trusted attestor; (b) required predicates hold (e.g., `kyc_pass == true`, `risk_score < threshold`, `country ∈ allowed`); (c) credential not revoked / is fresh.
   * The wallet does **not** reveal identity attributes; it only outputs the proof and a short attestor signature / attestor-issued token ID.

4. **Proof verification**

   * The protocol (off-chain service or on-chain verifier/contract) verifies the ZK proof and the attestor signature. If valid, it returns a **compliance token** (time-limited) or writes a small on-chain event (proof-verified, timestamp, attestor ID, proof hash).
   * The Board / Execution layer only sees that a compliance token / verified flag exists for the recipient — nothing else.

5. **Execution**

   * When allocation instructions include a recipient, the protocol requires a valid compliance token for the recipient (and possibly for the sender/provider, depending on your policy) before the Board executes transfers from the Verein account. If the token is missing or revoked, the transfer is blocked.

6. **Revocation & re-checks**

   * Attestors can revoke credentials (e.g., if sanctions appear). Revocation is checked via accumulator proofs or by short-lived tokens requiring periodic re-proof. If revoked, the compliance token is invalidated and future transfers are blocked.

---

# 4) Practical choices & tradeoffs

**Attestor model (who does KYC?)**

* Use an existing regulated KYC provider (e.g., local Swiss providers, crypto-friendly banks) to avoid regulatory risk.
* Alternatively, build your own attestor but it must be run under the appropriate legal/AML regime in Switzerland (more risk / cost).

**Proof system**

* **zk-SNARKs (Groth16/PLONK)**: small proof size and fast verification (good for on-chain). Need trusted setup in some schemes (PLONK and newer avoid complex setups).
* **Halo2 / STARKs**: transparent setup options (no trusted setup) and better scaling for complex predicates — but larger proofs / verification cost tradeoffs.

**Where to verify**

* **On-chain**: good for immutable, decentralized verification. But verification costs gas; use if you want proof recorded on-chain.
* **Off-chain oracle / relayer**: cheaper; the oracle verifies proofs and writes a lightweight attest (hash/timestamp) on-chain or into the protocol ledger. This is common for compliance gates.

**Revocation**

* **Accumulator-based revocation**: attestor maintains a Merkle/accumulator of valid credentials; proof includes membership; when revoked, credential removed. Efficient but requires updater.
* **Short-lived tokens**: simpler — attestor issues short expiration tokens; users must re-prove regularly.

**Auditability**

* Keep encrypted identity backups with attestors that auditors can access under legal process. ZK protects privacy in normal operation but allows regulators to investigate when legally required.

# 5) Concrete implementation blueprint (MVP)

Components, with technology suggestions:

1. **Attestor / KYC service**

   * Off-the-shelf compliant KYC provider (Onfido/Jumio-style) that you contract with; they perform checks and produce signed VCs.
   * Attestor exposes an API: `POST /issue-vc` (returns VC signed), `GET /revocation-status/:vc_id`.

2. **VC & Identity format**

   * Use **W3C Verifiable Credentials** with minimal attributes: `attestor_id`, `vc_id`, `issued_at`, `expiry`, and predicates (`kyc_pass`, `jurisdiction`, `risk_score_bucket`).
   * Signed by attestor’s DID key.

3. **Wallet & ZK proofs**

   * Wallet runs an embedded prover library (or mobile SDK) that:

     * Takes VC, constructs input for the ZK circuit.
     * Calls a circuit compiled via **Circom** / **snarkJS** (Groth16/PLONK) or **Halo2** toolchain to produce a proof.
   * Example circuits: `isKYCVerified(attestor_pubkey, vc_commitment) && notRevoked(vc_id) && jurisdiction_ok`.

4. **Proof verification & oracle**

   * Host an **oracle service** that verifies the ZK proof and attestor signature. If valid, it issues a **signed compliance token** (JWT or short on-chain receipt).
   * The protocol requires the compliance token before marking recipient verified.

5. **Revocation**

   * Attestor publishes a revocation Merkle root (or accumulator) and signs each root epoch. The ZK circuit proves membership in the non-revoked set or checks a freshness nonce signed by attestor.
   * Alternatively, require re-proof every N days.

6. **Integration with Resource Allocation Protocol**

   * Protocol checks `verifyCompliance(recipient)` before creating a transfer instruction that the Board must execute.
   * The Board sees only `recipient_id_hash` and `compliance_token_id` (no PII). Board verifies token signature and timestamp.

7. **Ledger & Audit**

   * Record: `allocation_id`, `recipient_pseudonym`, `proof_hash`, `attestor_id`, `timestamp`. Store proof_hash on ledger + full proof in attestor custody for possible audit.

---

# 6) Example data flows & API endpoints

Entities: User Wallet, Attestor, ZK Oracle, Protocol, Board

1. `POST /kyc/verify` (wallet → attestor) → attestor runs KYC and returns `VC` signed.
2. Wallet stores VC; when needed, wallet runs `proveKYC(predicate)` → produces `zk_proof` + `vc_commitment`.
3. Wallet calls `POST /proof/verify` (zk_oracle) with `zk_proof` and `vc_signature`.

   * If valid → oracle returns `compliance_token` (signed, TTL).
4. Protocol requires `compliance_token` before forming transfer instruction to Board.
5. Board reads instruction; verifies `compliance_token` signature (attestor/oracle key), then executes bank / crypto transfer.

---

# 7) Security & regulatory notes (must-reads)

* **Regulated attestor is mandatory in practice.** ZK proofs cannot replace the legal requirement that a regulated body identify customers where law requires it; they can *reduce* data exposure but the attestor must exist and keep records for audit. ([swissamf.com][2])
* **Record retention & audit access.** Keep encrypted identity data under attestor control; define legal process for auditors/regulators to obtain decrypted data if needed.
* **Revocation speed.** Sanctions lists and risk events change rapidly; design short TTLs for compliance tokens or near real-time revocation checks.
* **Proof soundness.** Use battle-tested zk toolchains (PLONK/PLONK-like or Halo2) and audited circuits. ZK circuit bugs can be catastrophic. ([ResearchGate][3])

---

# 8) Automating AML beyond KYC (continuous monitoring)

* **Perpetual KYC / risk scoring**: combine off-chain data sources and triggers (transaction patterns, news sentiment, sanctions changes) to update a member’s `risk_score`. Oracle reissues or revokes tokens when risk changes. (See perpetual KYC literature.) ([Oracle][4])
* **Transaction screening**: compute suspicious pattern scores off-chain; if a transfer matches a high-risk pattern, require escalation (manual review) before Board executes.
* **Thresholds & automated holds**: system auto-holds transfers above thresholds pending human review. That preserves safety while keeping routine small transfers automated.

---

# 9) Example minimal stack (MVP components & libs)

* **KYC attestor**: partner with a Swiss regulated provider (or use a licensed crypto custodian).
* **SSI wallet**: existing wallets supporting VCs (e.g., browser/mobile DID wallets) or custom wallet running JSON-LD VC + ZK proving.
* **ZK toolchain**: **Circom + snarkjs** (for quick MVP), or **PLONK / Halo2** for production. Use audited circuits. ([ResearchGate][5])
* **Oracle / verifier**: small service in Node/Python that verifies proof, checks attestor signature, emits token.
* **Accumulators**: Merkle trees or RSA/CL accumulators for revocation (attestor maintains root).
* **Protocol integration**: your Resource Allocation engine checks tokens before producing transfer instructions.
* **Ledger**: use your accounting ledger (automated) to log proof_hash and compliance_token_id alongside allocation entries for full auditability.

# 10) Example ZK predicate (pseudocode for the circuit)

```
Inputs:
  - vc_commitment  // commitment of the VC data
  - attestor_pubkey
  - revocation_root, revocation_witness
Private inputs:
  - vc_fields (country, kyc_pass, risk_score)
  - vc_signature
Circuit asserts:
  - verify_signature(attestor_pubkey, vc_commitment, vc_signature) == true
  - kyc_pass == 1
  - country in allowed_countries
  - risk_score <= allowed_threshold
  - vc_id ∈ non_revoked_set (using revocation_witness & root) OR (timestamp within TTL)
Output:
  - proof
```

---

# 11) Audit & immutability (how auditors can verify without violating privacy)

* Record only succinct hashes / Merkle roots on the ledger and keep full proofs off-chain with the attestor.
* If auditors need full PII, attestor can release decrypted records to auditors under a legal process; otherwise auditors verify cryptographic proof hashes + attestor signature chains.

---

# 12) Legal & governance checklist for Switzerland

* Contract with a regulated KYC provider or register as one if you perform checks yourself. (Swiss AML rules apply.) ([swissamf.com][2])
* Define retention policy & auditor access in statutes and policy documents.
* Log compliance token verification events in accounting records (proof hashes + attestor ID + timestamp) to demonstrate due diligence.
* Keep a manual escalation path for suspicious transfers (Board must be able to pause execution if legal risk arises).

---

# 13) Recommended next steps (practical, prioritized)

1. **Talk to a Swiss-licensed KYC provider** to confirm they will issue VCs and support revocation APIs.
2. **Prototype a ZK circuit** that proves a single predicate: `kyc_pass == true && not_revoked` using Circom/snarkjs (fast MVP).
3. **Build a small verifier/oracle** that verifies proofs and issues TTL compliance tokens.
4. **Integrate token checks** into your allocation protocol such that Board execution requires the token.
5. **Run an audit review** with a Swiss AML lawyer to ensure the workflow satisfies legal requirements (attestor, retention, reporting).

If you want I can:

* Draft an **end-to-end technical sequence diagram** (wallet → attestor → proof → oracle → protocol → Board) with exact API examples and sample JSON payloads;
* Produce a **minimal Circom circuit** and `snarkjs` commands for the `kyc_pass` predicate (proof-of-concept); or
* Draft the **attestor contract / API spec** (issue VC, revoke VC, publish revocation root, sign proofs).

Which of those would you like me to build next — the sequence diagram, a runnable Circom example, or the attestor API spec?
