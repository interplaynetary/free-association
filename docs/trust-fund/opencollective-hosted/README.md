# Open Collective Hosted Model

This directory contains governance documents for operating as a **Hosted Collective** on Open Collective.

## What is a Hosted Collective?

A hosted collective operates **without its own legal entity**. Instead:
- You use a **Fiscal Host** (like Open Collective Europe) as your legal entity
- The host holds your funds in their bank account
- The host handles all legal, tax, and compliance obligations
- You control your budget and activities on the Open Collective platform

**Key difference from Independent Collective:**
- **Hosted Collective:** No legal entity, hosted by OC Europe (Belgian non-profit)
- **Independent Collective:** Own legal entity (e.g., Swiss Verein), own bank account, just uses OC platform for transparency

## Our Model

**Fiscal Host:** Open Collective Europe ASBL (Belgian non-profit)  
**Jurisdiction:** Belgian law (not Swiss)  
**Governance:** Computational protocols (no traditional governance)  
**Transparency:** Full public budget on Open Collective  

## Key Benefits

✓ **No incorporation** - Start immediately, no legal setup  
✓ **No bank account** - OC Europe holds funds  
✓ **No tax/accounting** - OC Europe handles compliance  
✓ **Low overhead** - ~5% hosting fee covers everything  
✓ **Global payments** - Stripe, Wise, PayPal, bank transfers  
✓ **Full transparency** - Public budget on Open Collective

## Comparison to Swiss Verein Model

| Aspect | Hosted Collective (This) | Swiss Verein (pure/) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|

## When to Use Which Model

**Use Hosted Collective (this directory) when:**
- Starting quickly with minimal overhead
- Budget < $100K/year typically
- Don't need own legal entity
- Want lowest administrative burden
- Trust Open Collective Europe as host
- Transparency via OC is sufficient

**Use Swiss Verein (pure/ directory) when:**
- Need own legal entity
- Want full control and independence
- Budget > $100K/year typically
- Want to act as fiscal host for others
- Need specific legal structures
- Swiss jurisdiction required

## Getting Started

1. Read `governance.md` fully
2. Apply to create collective on opencollective.com
3. Select "Open Collective Europe" as fiscal host
4. Wait for approval (typically days)
5. Set up protocol infrastructure
6. Bootstrap initial members
7. Start operations

## Protocol Integration

The computational protocols work the same whether hosted or independent:
- MRD computation for membership
- Recognition-based resource allocation
- Decider for parameter changes
- Transparent, auditable, no governance overhead

Only difference: admins approve expenses on OC instead of Board signing bank transfers.
