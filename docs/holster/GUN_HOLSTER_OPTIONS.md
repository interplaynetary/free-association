# Gun & Holster Relay Options

The Gun and Holster relays from `server/gun-relay` and `server/holster-relay` are database protocol services, not typical REST APIs. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Keep Running via Docker (Recommended for Now)

If you still need Gun and Holster functionality, keep them running separately:

```bash
cd server
docker-compose up -d gun-relay holster-relay
```

They'll be available at:
- Gun: `http://localhost:8765/gun`
- Holster: `ws://localhost:8766/holster`

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- No changes needed to existing code
- Easy to scale independently

**Cons:**
- Need Docker installed
- Extra services to manage

## Option 2: Use Hosted/Public Relays

You already have fallback peers configured. Just remove the local relays and rely on public ones:

```typescript
// In src/lib/config.ts
export const config = {
  gun: {
    peers: [
      'https://104.248.129.153/gun',
      'https://gun-us.herokuapp.com/gun',
      // ... other public relays
    ]
  },
  holster: {
    peers: [
      'wss://holster.haza.website'
    ]
  }
};
```

**Pros:**
- No infrastructure to manage
- Instantly available
- No deployment needed

**Cons:**
- Depends on third-party services
- Less control over data
- May have usage limits

## Option 3: Embed in SvelteKit (Not Recommended)

You could technically embed these in SvelteKit using `hooks.server.ts`, but this is **not recommended** because:

1. Gun relay runs a WebSocket server that conflicts with SvelteKit's own WS handling
2. Holster also needs dedicated WebSocket management
3. These are long-running processes better suited to separate services
4. SvelteKit is optimized for HTTP/REST, not peer-to-peer protocols

If you really need to do this:

```typescript
// src/hooks.server.ts
import relay from '@gun-vue/relay';
import Holster from '@mblaney/holster';

// This is NOT recommended - shown for completeness only
relay.init({
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 8765,
  store: true,
  path: 'gun-data'
});
```

## Option 4: Replace with Alternative Storage

Consider replacing Gun/Holster with:

1. **IndexedDB** (client-side only)
   - Already in use via `@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb`
   - No server needed
   - Works offline

2. **Automerge + WebSocket**
   - You already have Automerge set up
   - Use `@automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket`
   - Can implement custom sync server

3. **Traditional Database**
   - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
   - More conventional approach
   - Better tooling

## Recommended Approach

For your current setup, I recommend:

1. **Short-term**: Use Option 2 (public relays)
   - Remove local relay dependencies
   - Test with public relays
   - Simplest migration path

2. **Medium-term**: Evaluate if you need decentralized storage
   - If yes: Keep Gun/Holster via Docker
   - If no: Migrate to traditional database

3. **Long-term**: Consolidate on Automerge
   - You already use Automerge for CRDTs
   - Implement custom sync server in SvelteKit
   - Full control, TypeScript-native

## Current Configuration

Your current `src/lib/config.ts` likely has:

```typescript
export const config = {
  gun: {
    peers: [
      import.meta.env.VITE_GUN_PEER_URL || 'http://localhost:8765/gun',
      // Fallbacks...
    ]
  }
};
```

To use public relays only, just don't set `VITE_GUN_PEER_URL` and rely on fallbacks.

## Migration Steps

### To Public Relays:

1. Update `.env`:
```env
# Remove or comment out local relay URLs
# VITE_GUN_PEER_URL=http://localhost:8765/gun
# VITE_HOLSTER_PEER_URL=ws://localhost:8766/holster
```

2. Test the application
3. Shut down local relays

### To Traditional Database:

1. Choose database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Set up Prisma (already installed)
3. Create schema for your data
4. Migrate Gun/Holster operations to DB queries
5. Remove Gun/Holster dependencies

## Questions to Consider

1. **Do you need decentralization?**
   - Yes → Keep Gun/Holster
   - No → Move to traditional DB

2. **Do you need offline-first?**
   - Yes → IndexedDB + sync
   - No → Server-side DB only

3. **Do you need CRDT capabilities?**
   - Yes → Automerge (already have it)
   - No → Traditional DB with optimistic updates

4. **How important is real-time sync?**
   - Critical → Keep P2P
   - Nice-to-have → WebSocket + DB
   - Not needed → REST API + DB
