Subject: Funding Request - Free Association: Building Tools for Equitable Resource Distribution

Dear Care for Future,

We are a network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools for equitable resource distribution. Through our "Free Association" framework, we connect surplus resources (housing, skills, food, time) to those who need them via distributed networks based on mutual recognition and support.

Our funding priorities include:

- Creating housing and food support networks
- Establishing resource-sharing networks across Berlin
- Hosting play-labs to engage diverse communities
- Developing an intuitive, open-source P2P interface
- Expanding our global solidarity network

Please see the attached brochure for more details about our work. We welcome the opportunity to discuss how our initiative might align with your funding priorities.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ruzgar Imski
