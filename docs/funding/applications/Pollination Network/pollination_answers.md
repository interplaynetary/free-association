# Pollination Network Application - Missing Answers

## Give us a sense of who you are?

## Project Pitch!

Playnet develops open-source tools that connect surplus resources to needs through mutual-recognition networks, creating practical alternatives to exploitative economic systems.

## Tell us about your project?

Free Association offers a concrete alternative to capitalist resource distribution by connecting surplus resources (housing, skills, food, time) to those who need them through networks based on mutual recognition. Unlike markets that restrict access through price mechanisms or states that centrally plan distribution, our approach creates pathways based on real contributions to each other's self-actualization. Our browser-based tool enables individuals to acknowledge contributions to their well-being, creating a mathematical foundation for distributing surplus. When you contribute surplus to Free Association, you aren't giving randomlyâ€”resources flow to those directly or indirectly aligned with your values. We hope to achieve: 1) A functional prototype that communities can use immediately, 2) Ten community play-labs to test and improve the system, 3) Beginning implementation in Berlin neighborhoods to address housing insecurity, and 4) Documentation to help others adopt these practices.

## What is your relationship to the community you are serving?

_Character limit: 1,000_

We are both serving and part of several interconnected communities. First, we're active within Berlin's solidarity networks, where several of our core members face housing insecurity while developing alternatives. Our work takes place in physical spaces through play-labs and in virtual spaces through our open-source platform (interplaynetary.github.io/free-association). Second, we engage with global networks of activists, cooperatives, and community groups searching for viable alternatives to exploitative economic systems. Our members come from diverse backgrounds including coding, activism, arts, and research, bringing varied lived experiences to our work. This diversity ensures we're creating tools that address real needs across different contexts. We maintain ongoing dialogue with users through workshops, feedback sessions, and collaborative development, ensuring the community shapes the tools rather than merely receiving them.

## What steps will you take to carry out this project?

_Character limit: 1,000_

1. Interface Development (May-September): Complete our browser-based p2p interface that implements free-association economics with no scaling limits or central points of failure. Focus on intuitive design and mobile accessibility.

2. Play-Lab Sessions (June-December): Host 10 play-labs across Berlin neighborhoods where participants design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution. Each 3-hour session includes practical exercises to understand mutual recognition, documentation, and feedback integration.

3. Community Implementation (December-June): Work with housing-insecure community members to establish working examples of surplus distribution networks in Berlin, starting with housing and skills sharing between participants.

4. Documentation (Ongoing): Create multilingual guides explaining how to use the tools and establish local networks, with tutorials and case studies accessible to non-technical users.

5. Contributor Support (October-September): Provide basic resources for 5 core contributors facing housing/financial insecurity while they develop these tools.

6. Partnership Building (May-September): Collaborate with other grassroots organizations to test implementations in diverse contexts.

## What is the projected impact of your project?

_Character limit: 1,000_

Our project will create tangible alternatives to resource allocation based on market mechanisms, directly impacting communities facing housing insecurity and economic marginalization. We'll track impact through:

- Volume and variety of resources shared through the network
- Number of housing solutions facilitated
- Geographic spread of implementation

The positive changes include:

- Immediate access to housing and other resources for community members in need
- Strengthened community bonds through mutual recognition relationships
- Practical demonstration that alternatives to market-based distribution are possible
- Development of new skills among participants
- Creation of replicable models that other communities can adapt

Long-term, we're building infrastructure for communities to meet needs without relying on exploitative systems, specifically addressing housing insecurity while creating pathways for all forms of surplus to flow where they're needed.

## Itemized budget for TPP funds

_Character limit: 1,000_

Web hosting for platform (12 months) @ $10/month = $120
Mobile data for platform testing (5 devices) @ $20 each = $100
Play-lab documentation materials:

- Digital recorder (1) @ $60 = $60
- Notebooks for participants (50) @ $2 each = $100
  USB flash drives for offline distribution (20) @ $6 each = $120

Total: $500

These items directly support our core activities: maintaining the platform, ensuring contributors can access and test it, documenting play-lab outcomes, providing physical materials for participants who may not have consistent digital access, and enabling offline distribution of the platform to communities with limited internet connectivity.

## Are you using any non-financial resources for your project?

_Character limit: 750_

Our project relies extensively on non-financial resources:

1. Volunteer Contributors: Our network includes 50 active contributors donating their expertise in coding, design, facilitation, and translation.

2. Knowledge Commons: We build on open-source technologies and frameworks, sharing all our code and documentation freely.

3. Shared Spaces: Community centers and partner organizations provide meeting spaces for play-labs and workshops.

4. Skill Sharing: Regular skill-sharing sessions where members teach each other programming, facilitation, and community organizing.

5. Equipment Lending: Members share computers, recording equipment, and other tools.

6. Partner Organizations: Collaborations with housing initiatives and community groups who provide connections to their networks and expertise.

7. Academic Partnerships: Research collaborations that provide theoretical frameworks and evaluation methodologies.
