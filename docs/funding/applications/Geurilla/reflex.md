**WHO WE ARE**  
We are a rapidly growing diverse Berlin-based network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools, frameworks, and economies for equitable resource distribution. Rooted in decolonial, feminist, and anti-hierarchical practices, we experiment with models that redistribute power and resources through mutual aid, trust, and collective creativity. 

We currently operate through a channel on telegram, regular meet-ups, spontaneous collaborations and play labs \- combining in-person connection in Berlin with online meetings and organising with our contributors based around the world.

A recent development, what we call “Free Association”, offers a crucial and timely alternative to capitalist structures by connecting surplus resources (housing, skills, food, time) to those who need them through distributed, mutual-recognition networks. As multiple global crises intensify \- from housing shortages to ecological breakdown and rising inequality \- traditional economic models are proving fundamentally inadequate.

**RISING INEQUALITY**  
Something that has become clear to us in the course of our experimentation is that:  
1\. Money is a transferable form of social recognition and recognition-power.

1. It is a means of socially-validating and recognizing contributions.  
2. It is the right to express social-value (through the medium of exchange: of course what can be valued in this frame is limited by what can be bought as commodity. Gifting money is the exception)

2\. The transferability of recognition-power is what enables its accumulation. 

Which means that:  
1\. Recognition-power becomes concentrated in fewer hands over time  
2\. Those with concentrated recognition-power get to decide what has value  
3\. They naturally value things that protect their accumulated recognition (military, police, legal systems protecting property rights)  
4\. This reinforces the entire system that enabled their accumulation in the first place

As well as that when you work:  
1\. You receive a token of social recognition (money)  
2\. You must surrender this token to survive (buy food)  
3\. The shop owner accumulates your recognition  
4\. They can use this accumulated recognition to purchase your labor power

And the cycle repeats, resulting in ever larger inequality, and ever grosser disproportion between real contribution and recognition-power accumulation as ever larger masses of people find themselves with an ever smaller capacity to express their values, to organize social-production around the realization of what they value, and to validate the contribution of others.

Free-Association offers a radical alternative by breaking this cycle through non-transferable recognition. When recognition can't be transferred or accumulated:  
1\. Each person retains 100% of their recognition power  
2\. No one can monopolize the power to determine what has value  
3\. Value can extend beyond commodities to anything that contributes to self-actualization  
4\. Power hierarchies based on accumulated recognition become impossible

In Free Association, validation of contributions happens through mutual recognition networks rather than through surrendering tokens of value. The recognition I give you for contributing to my self-actualization remains mine to give or redistribute, while simultaneously allowing you access to my surplus based on our mutual recognition.

This changes what society collectively values:  
1\. In market systems: Value flows primarily to what wealthy people want (luxury goods, military protection of assets, financial instruments)  
2\. In Free-Association: Value flows to whatever contributes to mutual self-actualization across the network (housing, food, education, community, environmental protection)

We believe this would transform our relationship with crucial issues like climate change, homelessness and inequality. Rather than being limited to expressing concern through purchasing air conditioners or carbon offsets (commodities), we could directly recognize and allocate surplus toward solving climate change itself or restoring ecological systems. The value isn't limited to what can be bought and sold.

**HOUSING**  
In Berlin specifically, our community members are experiencing first-hand the devastating impacts of market-based resource allocation. Several of our core contributors face housing insecurity while simultaneously dedicating their skills to building alternatives \- we seek to use our own lived experiences and the insights of wider community members to implement a solution that is both accessible for everyone and effective at ensuring adequate crowd sourced housing provision for people facing housing precarity or temporary homelessness.

The financialisation and increasing commercialisation of housing has created a market that excludes vast numbers of people or forces them to accept precarious and substandard living situations with exploitative landlords who profit from the provision of this core human need. This trend is only increasing, with the supply of affordable rental housing becoming less accessible to many community members \- particularly for new migrants, LGBTQI+ folks, those with low income or limited knowledge of the situation in Berlin.

While some people are able to access housing through informal networks of mutual aid (provided through friendship circles, community housing providers like Refugio or threatened projects like H48), these are often linked to social connection and exist within precarious spaces themselves \- facing legal challenges and external efforts to financialise these community assets as well.

From a Free-Association Lense Berlin's housing crisis is caused by the transferability of recognition-power (money). Landlords/investors accumulate recognition (rent/profits) extracted from tenants' survival needs. This accumulated power lets them buy more housing (further accumulation), dictate prices, and lobby for laws protecting their assets (police/legal systems). Tenants surrender recognition (rent) just to survive, losing power to influence the system.

In Free-Association, a contributor needing housing is recognized directly by others for their contributions (e.g., coding, organizing, childcare within the community). This recognition CANNOT be taken by a landlord or transferred into property ownership capital.

Surplus housing (e.g., an empty room offered by another member) is divided and offered according to mutual recognition, NOT on the tenant's ability to pay rent (surrender recognition) to a landlord who accumulates it.

The person offering the room receives recognition for that act from those who value it, but this recognition is non-transferable and non-accumulable. They can't use it to buy up more properties or become a landlord. Value flows to providing shelter, not extracting rent.

Housing becomes a directly recognized contribution to mutual self-actualization ("I offer shelter so you can thrive and contribute"), not a commodity generating transferable wealth for owners. This directly dismantles the financialization loop.

Housing is validated as a contribution to community flourishing, shifting resources away from accumulation and towards securing this basic need for all. This creates a resilient, decommodified alternative inaccessible under the transferable recognition system.

**CLIMATE & THREATENED ECOLOGICAL LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS**  
From a Free Association Lens, the climate crisis persists because transferable recognition (money) cannot adequately value non-commodifiable essentials (stable climate, biodiversity, clean air/water). "Solutions" (AC units, offsets) are mere commodities that generate profit (accumulate recognition) for sellers without fundamentally stopping ecological collapse. The system actively suppresses valuing long-term stewardship or intrinsic ecological worth because it doesn't generate transferable, accumulable recognition. We are "free" only to choose which commodity to buy, not to collectively value and protect the life-support system itself. We are told we live in a world of choice, yet our capacity to value and prioritize what truly matters \- human flourishing and ecological integrity \- is brutally constrained. 

In Free-Association, we are able to value the intangible: contributors performing ecological restoration (tree planting, wetland rehab, community education, policy advocacy) receive direct, non-transferable recognition from others for the act of stewardship itself.

Surplus resources (time, skills, materials, funds) can be directly allocated based on mutual recognition towards projects that actually restore ecosystems (e.g., "We collectively recognize the urgency of restoring this watershed and direct our surplus labor/materials there").

Value flows directly to the regenerative act, not to a corporation selling a mitigation gadget or credit. There is no intermediary accumulating recognition-power from the "solution."

Ecological integrity becomes a primary, directly recognized component of mutual self-actualization. The network can collectively decide to value and resource protection/restoration as a foundational need, bypassing the market's inability to price it and the state's capture by accumulation interests.

**WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE WORK**  
Over the past three years, we’ve engaged hundreds of people globally through “play-labs” and grown to a community of 50 active contributors based around the world. Play-labs are effectively games where communities design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution. Everything is documented and reincorporated into further developing our shared tools and practice. We operate transparently via Open Collective, where small donors sustain our core infrastructure.

We are currently preparing for the Zukunfts(T)Raum at the Carnival of Cultures this weekend (6th \- 9th June), where we will be building real mutual-aid networks across Berlin in the heart of the festival\! If you receive this message in time we invite you to visit us right in front of the ZLB central library right at Hallesches Tor. Contact @ruzgarimski on telegram if you need help finding us\!

Over the course of 4 days we have organized 3 yurts, a tiny house, workshop tents, an agora open forum for the people, a solidarity kiosk, in co-creation with many other groups and wonderful beings working together towards human flourishing.

We are providing access to food, water, electricity, internet, projectors, and can sleep in the yurts as a kind of pop-up village.

There will be all ages from children to grandmas, and we will have open space to play games and catalyze mutual-aid networks and organizations into existence. 

As this weekend an early prototype of free-association economy will be actually usable, we will explore the creation of games that correspond with the various phases/moments of the free-association economy, meaning games for:  
\- self-awareness  
\- desire-expression  
\- connection and trust  
\- gratitude  
\- mutual-recognition  
\- capacity-offering

Following our set up from the carnival will additionally be brought over to Funding the Commons Forum Berlin where we will also share free-association and mingle with others desiring to bring commons and mutual-aid into the world.

Following that we are voyaging to the Netherlands where we will meet with various activist/artist/scientist groups planting the seeds of Playnet Netherlands\!

**Find a title for your project / activity / core funding ✅**

Playnet: Free-Association  
Host at least 10 publicly accessible playnet sessions (across at least 3 countries in Europe) to test and iterate new economic forms and interfaces while supporting our core team of developers and facilitators to implement, test and scale our first deployment of Free Association \- focusing specifically on addressing the housing crisis in Berlin and the Netherlands.

**What do you hope to achieve with this grant? \* ✅**  
**Describe specific activities ⏳**  
**and hoped-for short term outcomes. ✅**  
**How will these support you in achieving your group's longer term goals? ✅**

**Activities**  
\- Contributor Stability Support: Provide basic monthly stipends for 5 core developers/facilitators facing housing and financial insecurity while they dedicate time to this critical work (300 euros per month each for 3 months, at total cost of 4500 euros)

\- Distributed Berlin: Establish surplus distribution and sharing networks across several neighborhoods in Berlin, the Netherlands, and beyond, on the basis of mutual recognition and mutual support using free association economics. With the housing crisis intensifying, our community has identified this as a key first priority. We will implement free-association economics in an intuitive, open source, p2p interface (no scaling limits or centralized points of failure) free for all at a total cost of 2000 euros. We aim to assist with the housing of at least 250 people in the first year of operation (although the mathematics of free-association exponential network effects means that in principle it is very hard to estimate the upper bound of what we are capable of, 250 is extremely conservative given a functioning protocol/interface)

\- Community Growth: Host 10 play-labs across Berlin and other cities, engaging underrepresented and precarious groups at a total cost of 1500 euros.

\- Global Partnerships: Work with partner networks to experiment together with play-labs in a wide range of diverse contexts, drawing on a vast wealth of lived experience \- at a total cost of 1000 euros.

\#\# Risks & How We Address Them

Our system confronts several key challenges, but we've built proactive strategies directly into its design and operation:

1\.  Risk: People gaming the system (e.g., teams unfairly boosting "recognition" to hoard resources).  
    How we handle it: We let the system self-regulate. Attempts at gaming necessarily lead to less resources without the need for any central authority (see derived proof on Github).

 Risk: Technological or Mathematical Exploit: (Despite robust p2p encryption, unknown vulnerabilities).  
    How we handle it: We use military-grade encryption in a distributed p2p architecture with no central attack point or central servers. Furthermore, because our community includes mathematicians, we engage in ongoing, proactive audits and collaboration with the wider mathematical community to identify and mitigate any potential as of yet unknown mathematical exploits.

2\.  Risk: Tech getting overwhelmed (scalability under high demand).  
    How we handle it: Our core infrastructure uses a distributed, peer-to-peer architecture secured with military-grade encryption and no central servers, inherently designed for resilience and avoiding single points of failure or overload. While scaling presents challenges, this architecture provides a robust foundation.

3\.  Risk: Leaving folks out (tech access barriers, especially for marginalized communities).  
    How we handle it: We organize from the bottom up, with local crews, and community hubs

4\.  Risk: Legal headaches (e.g., non-standard housing/sharing arrangements conflicting with regulations).  
    How we handle it: We strategically "play nice(ish) with the rules". This means partnering with housing co-ops, legal aid groups, and advocates to navigate complexities and push cities to recognize these efforts as essential crisis support, aiming for regulatory acceptance.

5\.  Risk: Burnout vibes.  
    How we handle it: As a community of practice we are already practicing these principles of mutual aid and support, so we make efforts to ensure everyone is sheltered and fed. We additionally want to secure grants to provide stipends for core contributors.

6\.  Risk: "Why fix what’s broken?" pushback (resistance from entrenched capitalist mindsets).  
    How we handle it: We aim relentlessly to prove it works by sharing powerful, concrete success stories (e.g., "Our extra room housed a migrant artist who revitalized our community garden\!"). Making participation and contribution something people are genuinely proud of counters skepticism and builds cultural momentum.

7\.  Risk: Running on fumes (insufficient physical resources like housing).  
    How we handle it: We prioritize matching for the most urgent needs (e.g., housing for caregivers, disaster victims). Crucially, we link up with existing aid groups and solidarity networks to pool resources and avoid duplication, maximizing impact with available means.

How do you usually fund your activities? ✅  
What are additional funding sources in case this grant would not cover the entire cost of the activities planned?  
Please also name other Foundations you have received funding from in the past. ✅

Thus far we have been entirely community funded, drawing on a combination of regular and one-off donations via our Open Collective. 

We have not yet received any funding from other Foundations or grants and have only recently started applying for grants as we are ready to scale and launch.

How do diversity and intersectionality factor into your group culture/team dynamics and your work for radical change?

Our community operates according to the principles of free-association and mutual-aid. Diversity and intersectionality are foundational to our group’s ethos and operational practice. Our team comprises individuals from varied backgrounds \- including migrants, LGBTQ+ activists, artists, and technologists \- who bring lived experiences of systematic marginalization into our collaborative processes. We build tools for organization across all strata of society. We have community members who are part of student parliaments, representatives of migrant wellbeing organisations, open-tech collectives and activists from a wide range of civil society organisations. Intersectionality is of deep interest to every single one of us and right at the heart of how we operate.

Permissionless innovation: allow experimentation without centralized approval. Providing an entirely open-source toolkit also means that Free Association is infinitely forkable and can be taken by any organisation or community/mutual-aid network to be tailored for their own unique geo-social contexts \- we keep all repos accessible with clear documentation and well-structured code, while offering guidance for any group that seeks to implement our tools for their own need-based contexts. 

Multi-lingual support is also a key priority for us and something we are already beginning to implement \- making it as easy as possible for those from diverse linguistic backgrounds to use the toolkits.

During the development of our decentralized/distributed platforms, we engage directly with migrant collectives, other networks of precarious community members and justice-centered organizations to co-design features that address intersecting barriers to access, such as inclusivity and adaptive interfaces. Our community is brought together from many different backgrounds and we are united in shared social-material interests. We aim to satisfy the concrete real needs of each other and the community while simultaneously collaborating towards achieving societal transformation and creating the post-capitalist infrastructure necessary for the relations to scale.

What support (in addition to funding) do you think we could provide?

\- Working together to iterate and develop our open source platform \- we are always looking for inspiring organisations and groups to connect and test with. If there are collectives you are working with or you yourselves think it might be worth implementing it to assist resource governance within Guerilla Foundation, we would love that opportunity.  
\- Access to physical spaces \- such as community centers in Neukölln or Kreuzberg \- would enable us to host workshops and outreach programs for populations less engaged with digital platforms.   
\- Mentorship from seasoned practitioners who have successfully scaled mutual-aid initiatives without compromising their values would provide invaluable guidance.   
\- Media partnerships to highlight nuanced narratives around solidarity economies, beyond superficial tech optimism, could also broaden public understanding and engagement.  
\- Connecting with movements and radical groups who could benefit from infrastructure for scaling mutual-aid, along with “everyday” groups that might benefit from their own self-governed system of resource distribution/allocation \- think libraries, community knitting groups, queer sports teams, art collectives, activist networks. Ideally these connections would occur with organisations based in Berlin, Amsterdam, other cities across Europe and the wider world

Who else in your field should we definitely know about (and maybe support)?:  
Hackers & Designers: An Amsterdam-based collective bridging technology, art, and activism through open-source tools and participatory workshops, empowering communities to reclaim digital infrastructures.
