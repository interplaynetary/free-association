Subject: Free Association: Let's Make Philanthropy Obsolete

Dear Leap,

We came across your website and see deep alignment with your values. We're both working toward a world centered on ecological and social wellbeing where philanthropy itself becomes unnecessary. I think we could have a very interesting conversation.

I'm writing to you on behalf of Playnet, we are a rapidly growing diverse Berlin-based network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools for equitable resource distribution. Over three years, we've engaged hundreds globally through "play-labs" - games where communities design and test systems for self-organized surplus distribution.

Our work on "Free Association" offers a crucial alternative to capitalist structures by connecting surplus resources through distributed, mutual-recognition networks. As housing shortages, ecological breakdown, and inequality intensify, our work isn't merely theoretical - it's an urgent practical response to converging crises.

We seek funding for:

- Establishing surplus distribution networks across Berlin neighborhoods
- Implementing free-association in an open-source, p2p interface, available free for all
- Hosting 10 play-labs engaging underrepresented and precarious groups in economic system design, exploration, and experimentation

We'd love to have a conversation about how Free Association might align with Leap's experimental approach to philanthropy!

In solidarity,
RÃ¼zgar Imski,
