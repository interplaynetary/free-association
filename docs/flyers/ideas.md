## FREE-ASSOCIATION MAY 1ST FLYER-GAME CONTENT:

## Brochure (can be folded differently to reveal hidden instructions) Some text only can be read backwards (mirror reading)

Create 5 distinct poster versions that each contain:
A fragment of a larger context
Unique puzzle elements that only make sense when combined with other versions
A specific "capacity category" (housing, skills, food, transportation, creative)

Each version has a distinct color scheme/identifier (like "the red coordinate," "the blue nexus")

Include text: "This is 1/5 of the Free-Association revelation. Find other contributors to complete the network."

**HEADLINE:**
"FREE-ASSOCIATION: THE MATHEMATICS OF MUTUAL SELF-ACTUALIZATION"

**SUBHEADLINE:**
"NETWORK→PLAYNET: LESS WORK, MORE PLAY!"

**KEY POINTS (PRESENTED IN SURREAL BUT INFORMATIVE STYLE):**

_Free-Association_ is a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the _spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other_ without any centralized control, planning, private-property, state intervention!

This requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (tangible and intangible contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.).

**_free-association_** essentially unifies the concepts of **_mutual-aid_**, **_mutual-recognition_**, **_mutual-fulfillment_**, and **_surplus-distribution_** in a single elegant and coherent framework that creates the mathematical foundations for a scalable gifting economy of co-creative abundance.

You can interact with an interface implementing this logic at [interplaynetary.github.io/free-association](https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association/) (in active development) (p2p, distributed, running in the browser - no need for a download - for free)

**CALL TO ACTION:**
"JOIN THE CAPACITY INVENTORY SESSION - MAY 1ST"
"Bring what you can offer, discover what others provide"
[Include specific location, time, and date details here]

**BOTTOM TEXT:**
"THE PLAYNET provides non-liable encouragement towards NONCHALANCE, divine grace, and consistent emergence through subverted suggestions & disguised guidance."
"Bottom Secret: Recognition is always reciprocal in Free-Association"

### Here's how it works:

1. Your **Recognition** is your acknowledgment of _contributions towards your own self-actualization_

   - Always represents a share/portion/percentage of one's total recognition (100%)
   - Non-transferable (unlike shares or equity that can be traded)
   - Dynamically (re)adjustable as relationships and contributions evolve
   - Not limited to direct personal consumption - recognition can be given to those contributing to broader social values and needs you care about.

2. Your **Total-Recognition** is always _100%_.

3. Your **Mutual Recognition** with another is the minimum of your recognition of each other.

   - For example: If you are 50% of my _total-recognition_, and I am 10% of your _total-recognition_, our mutual-recognition is 10%, the minimum of the both.
     - _Taking the minimum of both shares ensures reciprocity in proportion._
     - This is _mutual-recognition of mutual-contribution towards each other's self-actualization_.

4. **Shares of Surplus** are distributed across networks of _mutual-recognition of mutual-contribution_ at a declared **network-depth**.

   - Shares are percentages of 100%. They are dynamically _(re)attributed_ and _non-transferable_.
   - Shares of a particular surplus are shares of a _capacity-to-provide_ (they are shares of _verbs_, not shares of a _objects_).
   - _Network-depth_ can be (re)declared dynamically.
   - For example: surplus-housing might be shared at depth = 2, whereas surplus-food might be shared at depth = 5.
   - Absolute quantities can be (re)declared dynamically (today you have the capacity to provide 2 rooms, tomorrow 40, the day after 40 etc.)

5. Your **direct-share** in another's **surplus-capacity** equals _your mutual recognition with them, divided by their total-mutual-recognition with all others_

   - For example: If we have 10% of _mutual-recognition_, and you are my only _mutual-relationship_, you would have 100% of my **total-mutual-recognition** (100% of my **direct-share**). If I have two _mutual-relationships_ each with 10% mutual-recognition, each would have 50% of my **total-mutual-recognition** (50% of my **direct-share**).

6. Your **total-share** in another's _surplus-capacity_ combines your _direct-share_ with _transitive-share_ through the network.
   - For example: You share in not just of your friends' surplus, but also friends of friends (up to the capacities' declared network depth).
   - **Direct Share (Depth 1)**: Your immediate _share_ based on mutual recognition
   - **Transitive Shares (Depth 2-6)**: _shares_ gained through network connections
   - Each additional depth traverses one more relationship connection
   - Transitive shares are calculated by multiplying direct shares along each unique path
   - Paths already visited are tracked to prevent circular calculations
   - Example: Your _share_ of C's surplus through connection B = (Your direct share of B) × (B's direct share of C)

MUTUAL CONTRIBUTION MECHANICS
Each poster contains "I OFFER:" and "I SEEK:" sections for participants to fill out
Players write their actual capacities/needs in their poster's category
When posters connect, people immediately see potential mutual-contribution matches

# Goals

- Grow Playnet Community
- Organize Artists towards Exhibition (post-capitalist expression)
- Capacity Inventory (Get people together, and declare capacities, and then freely-associate)

# Playnet

Net*work* -> *Play*net
Less work more play!
That's the politics
Playnet.lol

## Vibes

Each poster should incorporate elements of absurdism, genuine mystery, and just enough concrete information to make them actionable while maintaining the surreal, playful nature of the Playnet aesthetic. The designs should have multiple layers of meaning, with hidden messages or symbols that reward careful examination, similar to how the Jejune Institute created an immersive alternate reality experience through their media.

So one of the things that we're thinking is like having holes in the flyer cut out over images that show us where we need to go so when you hold up the card on the backdrop of the surrounding you actually see the place where you need to go and we just give you the coordinates to find the place where you need to go.

and also the yeah that show like a free association if I universe like the place is how it was before except things have changed because now there's like I don't know more resources being shared and people are happier there's no cops or teslas

yeah like the backdrop the image that through which we see the whole is like the future exactly yeah and we're just like talking just

## Corner fold reveals - Messages hidden in corners that only become visible when folded inward along diagonal lines

Basically, you'd print like 3 to 5 different versions of the poster and you would hand them out but in order to find the full picture you have to find other people who have different versions of the poster so that each version of the poster fits together like a puzzle piece to reveal a bigger picture.

### Goes directly into organizing, this a huge way to organize mutual-contribution.
