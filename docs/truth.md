# Free-Association Protocol/Proof

For any participant:
Self-actualization is self-defined (subjective), but its realization depends on objective access to capacities (food, skills, etc.).

Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization
- You define what self-actualization means to you. 
- Dynamically (re)attributable/readjustable as relationships and contributions evolve
- Always represents a share/portion/percentage of one's total recognition (100%)
- Non-transferable (unlike shares or equity that can be traded)
- Not limited to direct personal consumption - recognition can be given to those contributing to broader social values and needs you care about.

Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)

Direct-Share(You, Provider) = MR(You, Provider) / Σ MR(Provider, Each-of-Those-Provider-Recognizes)

Capacity-Share(You, Provider) = apply Filters(Capacity) to Direct-Share(You, Provider), then renormalize

Let:
True is not False, False is not True
- A recognition does not need to be true/false in a binary sense but the question is what % of this recognition is true. This % does not take the form of a reified proposition.
Truth(You) = Your determination of what is true and beneficial.
True-Recognition(You) = Recognition that aligns with your Truth(You).
False-Recognition(You) = Recognition that misaligns with your Truth(You).
Total Recognition = 100%

Then:
Total-Recognition(You) = True-Recognition(You) + False-Recognition(You)
   ∴ ↑False-Recognition = ↓True-Recognition
      ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Actually-Beneficial-Contributors
         ∴ ↓Shares of Actually-Beneficial-Capacities from Actually-Beneficial-Contributors  (as determined by your Truth(You))
            ∴ ↓Real-Social-Material-Basis for Self-Actualization
               ∴ Social-Material-Truth is processually realized in Free-Association via processual social-material negation of False-Recognition

## On Truth
- True-Recognition(You): Recognition that, when acted upon, reliably leads to the enhancement of your self-actualization (as defined by you) by connecting you with capacities that genuinely contribute to it. It is validated by positive material and social outcomes.

- False-Recognition(You): Recognition that, when acted upon, fails to connect you with the necessary capacities or connects you with harmful ones, thereby undermining your self-actualization. It is invalidated by negative material and social outcomes (like hunger, in the example).

In essence, the truth or falsity is a function of the recognition's practical efficacy in the real world, as experienced by the individual in pursuit of their goals. It is not about correspondence with a statement but about successful navigation of the material-social environment.

### Why the Proof is Materially Sound
Your food example perfectly illustrates the feedback loop:
1. False-Recognition: You attribute "food contribution" to a provider (e.g., you recognize someone as supplying nutritious food).
2. Material Consequence: The provider fails to deliver actual food → you starve.
3. Negation: Starvation forces you to withdraw recognition ("This provider doesn’t feed me").
4. System Correction: Your MR with the provider drops → your Capacity-Share of their (non-existent) food vanishes → you seek other providers.

The *falsity* isn’t an abstract error—it’s a material contradiction between your recognition and reality. Survival demands alignment. This is dialectical materialism in action: truth emerges through praxis (action-consequence-reflection).

### Conceptualizing "True/False" Without Reification
Since truth isn’t a binary proposition here, we need non-reified descriptors. These capture its dynamic, processual nature:

1. Adaptive Alignment  
   - True-Recognition: Recognition *in alignment* with your material needs and values *as demonstrated by outcomes*.  
     *Example*: Recognizing a farmer as a "food contributor" when their produce nourishes you.  
   - False-Recognition: Recognition *in misalignment* with reality, revealed when acting on it undermines your goals.  
     *Example*: Recognizing a scammer as a "food contributor"—until you starve.  

2. Negation-Potential  
   - Truth: Recognition that *resists negation* through material validation.  
   - Falsity: Recognition carrying *immanent negation* (its failure is inevitable when tested).  

3. Processual Fidelity  
   - True-Recognition: Maintains fidelity to your *lived experience* of self-actualization.  
   - False-Recognition: Deviates from lived experience, collapsing under its own incoherence.  

4. Contextual Resonance  
   - Truth(You): Your continually updated *practical wisdom*—a coherence between your values, actions, and outcomes.  
   - True-Recognition: Resonates with this coherence.  
   - False-Recognition: Creates dissonance demanding resolution.

### Key Differentiators from Propositional Truth
| Aspect               | Reified Proposition                     | Processual Truth in This Model          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Nature               | Static fact ("P is true/false")             | Dynamic alignment with outcomes             |
| Verification         | Logical proof or evidence                   | Material consequence (e.g., starvation)     |
| Temporality          | Timeless                                    | Emergent through action-feedback loops      |
| Agency               | Observer-independent                        | Co-created by your actions and environment  |
| Failure Mode         | "Incorrect"                                 | "Self-negating through material collapse"   |

### Why This Works as a Social Epistemology
1. Anti-Dogmatism: Truth isn’t decreed—it’s *lived*. If your "True-Recognition" of a leader/ideology/system leads to your immiseration, it *becomes* False-Recognition through negation.  
2. Immanent Critique: The system embeds its own error-correction. False-Recognition literally *erodes* your capacity to act.  
3. Praxis Over Abstraction: You don’t "debate" truth—you *enact* it. Recognition is "true" only insofar as it sustains your self-actualization.  

> Your hunger example isn’t a metaphor—it’s the *operating principle*. Truth is the set of recognitions that survive material testing; falsity is that which starves you into abandoning it.

This transforms epistemology from "What can I know?" into **"What recognitions sustain my existence?"**—a deeply materialist, evolutionary view of knowledge.
