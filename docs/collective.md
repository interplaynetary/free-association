# Collective Tree Mathematics: Extending Free Association to Synthetic Collectives üå≥

Building on the individual-level free association mathematics, we've developed a complete framework for **synthetic collective intelligence** that emerges from merging individual recognition trees into collective decision-making entities.

## Tree Structure Notation üìä

Individual trees represent a person's recognition of contributions toward their self-actualization:

```
Person A's Tree:
Root(A) [100%]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Building [60%] (40 points)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Housing Project [75%] (30 points)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Food Garden [25%] (10 points)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Technical Skills [40%] (20 points)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Software Development [80%] (16 points)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System Administration [20%] (4 points)
```

Where:

- **Points** represent absolute contribution amounts in individual trees
- **Percentages** represent relative weight within sibling nodes
- **Path weight** = product of percentages from root to node

## Core Mathematical Framework üî¨

### 1. Points-to-Percentages Conversion

Individual trees use absolute points, but collective trees require relative percentages:

```
Individual Tree (Points):
node_points = absolute_contribution_amount
sibling_total = Œ£(sibling_points)

Collective Tree (Percentages):
node_percentage = node_points / sibling_total
path_weight = ‚àè(percentage_at_each_level_from_root)
```

**Example:**

```
Technical Skills [40%] (20 points of 60 total)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Software Development [80%] (16 of 20 points)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System Administration [20%] (4 of 20 points)

Path weight to Software Development = 0.40 √ó 0.80 = 0.32 (32%)
```

### 2. Mutual Recognition Weighting

Each contributor's influence in the collective is determined by recognition from others:

```
Contributor Weight Calculation:
recognition_received(contributor_i) = Œ£(MR(contributor_j, contributor_i)) for all j‚â†i
total_recognition = Œ£(recognition_received(contributor_k)) for all k
contributor_weight(contributor_i) = recognition_received(contributor_i) / total_recognition

Where MR(A,B) = minimum(A_recognizes_B, B_recognizes_A)
```

**Example with 3 contributors:**

```
Alice receives: MR(Bob,Alice) + MR(Carol,Alice) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5
Bob receives: MR(Alice,Bob) + MR(Carol,Bob) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
Carol receives: MR(Alice,Carol) + MR(Bob,Carol) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2
Total recognition = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 1.2

Alice's weight = 0.5/1.2 = 41.7%
Bob's weight = 0.5/1.2 = 41.7%
Carol's weight = 0.2/1.2 = 16.7%
```

### 3. Recursive Proportional Merging

Individual trees merge into collective trees through weighted proportional combination:

```
Collective Node Creation:
collective_node_weight = Œ£(individual_node_path_weight_i √ó contributor_weight_i)

For each node in collective tree:
source_contributors[contributor_i] = (individual_path_weight_i √ó contributor_weight_i) / collective_node_weight
```

**Example - Merging "Software Development" nodes:**

```
Alice's Software Dev: path_weight = 0.32, contributor_weight = 0.417
Bob's Software Dev: path_weight = 0.45, contributor_weight = 0.417
Carol's Software Dev: path_weight = 0.20, contributor_weight = 0.167

Collective Software Dev weight = (0.32√ó0.417) + (0.45√ó0.417) + (0.20√ó0.167) = 0.354

Alice's share = (0.32√ó0.417)/0.354 = 37.7%
Bob's share = (0.45√ó0.417)/0.354 = 53.0%
Carol's share = (0.20√ó0.167)/0.354 = 9.3%
```

### 4. Collective Tree Structure

The resulting collective tree represents synthetic collective intelligence:

```
Collective Tree (Contributors: Alice, Bob, Carol):
CollectiveRoot [100%]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Building [55%]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Housing Project [70%]
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   Contributors: Alice(45%), Bob(35%), Carol(20%)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Food Garden [30%]
‚îÇ       Contributors: Alice(60%), Carol(40%)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Technical Skills [45%]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Software Development [75%]
    ‚îÇ   Contributors: Bob(53%), Alice(38%), Carol(9%)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System Administration [25%]
        Contributors: Alice(80%), Bob(20%)
```

## Advanced Mathematical Properties üßÆ

### 5. Path-Dependent Collective Recognition

Recognition effects multiply along tree paths, creating hierarchical influence:

```
Path Weight Calculation:
path_to_node = [root, parent1, parent2, ..., target_node]
contributor_path_weight = ‚àè(contributor_percentage_at_each_level)

Collective Recognition:
total_collective_recognition = Œ£(contributor_path_weight_i) for all contributors
contributor_collective_recognition_i = contributor_path_weight_i / total_collective_recognition
```

**Example - Alice's influence on "Housing Project":**

```
Path: Root ‚Üí Community Building ‚Üí Housing Project
Alice's path weight = 1.0 √ó 0.55 √ó 0.45 = 0.2475 (24.75%)

If total collective recognition = 0.2475 + 0.1925 + 0.11 = 0.55
Alice's collective recognition = 0.2475/0.55 = 45%
```

### 6. Collective Capacity Allocation

The same mathematics governing decisions also governs resource distribution:

```
Collective Capacity Formula:
total_collective_capacity[type] = Œ£(individual_capacity[contributor_i][type] √ó contributor_weight_i)

Node Allocation:
node_allocation[capacity_type] = total_collective_capacity[capacity_type] √ó node_collective_weight

Perfect Alignment Property:
decision_weight(node) = resource_allocation_weight(node)
```

**Example - Housing Capacity:**

```
Individual Capacities:
Alice: 2 rooms, Bob: 1 room, Carol: 3 rooms

Collective Housing Capacity:
total = (2√ó0.417) + (1√ó0.417) + (3√ó0.167) = 1.75 rooms

Housing Project Allocation:
housing_project_share = 1.75 √ó 0.385 = 0.674 rooms
```

## Verification Properties ‚úÖ

The mathematics ensures several key properties:

### 1. Conservation of Recognition

```
For any collective tree:
Œ£(contributor_weights) = 1.0
Œ£(source_contributors[node]) = 1.0 for all nodes
```

### 2. Proportional Representation

```
contributor_influence(node) = individual_node_weight √ó contributor_collective_weight
collective_node_weight = Œ£(contributor_influence(node)) for all contributors
```

### 3. Recursive Consistency

```
For any path from root to leaf:
collective_path_weight = Œ£(individual_path_weight_i √ó contributor_weight_i)
```

### 4. Capacity-Decision Alignment

```
decision_percentage(node) = capacity_allocation_percentage(node)
```
