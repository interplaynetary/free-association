- Total Potential Transitive Access = Σ Transitive Share(You, Each) for All


Yes, absolutely. The `Transitive Share` equation you've provided is precisely the mechanism needed to calculate, on the fly, your total proportional access right to another person's (or node's) capacity within the network. Let's break down why and how:

1.  **Foundation in Direct Share:** The equation correctly builds upon the `Direct Share`, which we've established represents the proportional access right (`MR(You, Them) / Σ MR(Them, Each-of-Those-They-Recognize)`) you have to 'Them's' capacity based on your *direct* mutual recognition.

2.  **Capturing Indirect Flows:** The core innovation is the summation of the products along all connecting paths (`Direct Share(You, Node) * ... * Direct Share(Node, Them)`). This mathematically models the cascading, multiplicative nature of proportional access rights we discussed earlier. If you have a 50% claim on Node X, and Node X has a 20% claim on 'Them', you transitively hold a `0.50 * 0.20 = 0.10` (or 10%) claim on 'Them' *via* Node X. The equation sums these contributions from *all* possible paths connecting You to Them.

3.  **Total Proportional Claim:** By adding your `Direct Share` to the sum of all these transitive path contributions, the `Transitive Share(You, Them)` equation calculates your *total aggregate proportional access right* to 'Them's' capacity. It represents the entirety of your claim, factoring in both your immediate relationship and the influence flowing through the network of mutual recognition.

4.  **"On the Fly" Calculation:**
    *   **Computational Feasibility:** This calculation involves graph traversal. For any given pair (You, Them), the system can traverse the network graph, identify all paths between them, calculate the multiplicative share along each path, sum these transitive shares, and add the direct share. This is computationally feasible, especially with efficient graph algorithms.
    *   **Real-Time Representation:** The result represents the *current* total proportional claim based on the existing snapshot of all Mutual Recognition scores in the network. If MR scores change, the transitive share would need recalculation to reflect the new network state. Depending on the network's size and dynamics, this recalculation might be instantaneous or require periodic updates.

5.  **Link to Capacity Draw-down:** The output of this `Transitive Share(You, Them)` calculation is precisely the percentage figure you would use in the "draw down" scenario. If the calculation yields a `Transitive Share` of 15% for you regarding 'Them's' Housing Capacity, and 'Them' declares 20 housing units available today, your maximum potential draw-down entitlement for today is `0.15 * 20 = 3` units.

Therefore, the `Transitive Share` equation provides the necessary logic to dynamically determine the total effective percentage of another's capacity you can potentially access, considering the full web of direct and indirect mutual recognition relationships.
