**Mathematically defined:**
```
Let:
- One's Recognition = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization
- One's Total-Recognition = 100%
- Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)
- Your share of anyone's surplus = MR(You, Them) / Σ MR(Them, Those-They-Recognize)
```

The ambiguity of whether "them" is singular or plural is intentional.
```
For an individual:
MR(You, Person) = min(Their-share-of-Your-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-recognition)

For a collective:
MR(You, Collective) = min(Collective's-share-of-Your-recognition, Your-share-of-Collective's-recognition)

When Collective-Recognition emerges:
- The collective's total recognition = 100%
- Individual members contribute to collective recognition
- The collective can distribute surplus based on mutual recognition
- Yet individuals maintain their own recognition relationships

Housing Cooperative example:
- You recognize the cooperative's contribution to housing security (20%)
- The cooperative recognizes your contributions to maintenance (15%)
- MR(You, Cooperative) = min(20%, 15%) = 15%
- Your share of cooperative's surplus = 15% / Σ MR(Cooperative, All-Its-Contributors)
