Relations as Communication channels:
- **Let:** Total-bandwidth
- **Let:** Default: Bandwidth-per-relation
    - Receptivity = shareOfGeneralFulfillment (each side can have un-reciprocal receptivity)
    - Receptivity-Override = shareOfGeneralFulfillment-Override
        - **Let:** Default-Override: Bandwidth-per-relation-type
        - **Let:** Default-Override-Per-Node: Bandwidth-per-relation-type-per-node
        - **Let:** Default-Override-Per-Node-Per-Edge: Bandwidth-per-relation-type-per-node-per-edge
        - **Let:** Default-Override-Per-Node-Per-Edge-Per-Relation: Bandwidth-per-relation-type-per-node-per-edge-per-relation

// We could have associations be parent nodes of relations.
