With regard to organizations/states:

- Leafs are the smallest units of an organization.
- Their categories are composition of labor-associations (Like workers councils in soviets)
- There should be some kind of an equation for bottom up determination of proportions of children within a parent by the children themselves.
- Where perhaps they can allocate only to others and not to themselves?
- When children are not leaves how does this work?

- Copy-allocation: copy the allocation of another (within a scope) with a % of your allocation-power.
