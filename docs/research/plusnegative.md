# Plus Negative

## Questions:
- should we have "negative" recognition (0, -1]? which is distinct from "positive" (0, 1] recognition or even "no" recognition [0].

- positive-recogition: the true the good the beautiful 
- negative-recognition: the false the bad the ugly
- no-recognition: the neutral the neutral the neutral

- What use is it to have "negative" recognition? In what social-contexts is "negative" recognition useful?

- should trees be hidden? What does it mean to hide your intentions?

- If they were public, one would be able to navigate the social-graph of the social-world (and interconnected web of recognizers and recognitions) to understand the needs of others!

- What if there was mutual-negative recognition? 
- Would it be a way of closing the doors on the social-graph?
- how does it differ from "no" recognition?
- Would one-way negative recognition be a way of closing the doors (one-way) on the social-graph?

- negative recognition is a way of saying "I don't want to be friends with you" (like blocking someone on social media but in degrees rather than a binary)

- one doesn't hide one's intentions, one becomes less visible. One becomes smaller as a proportion of another's whole self. Takes a less visible role in the social-graph.




Ah, these clarifications help reframe the analysis significantly! Let me provide updated expert perspectives:

1. **On Graduated Social Distance (Negative Recognition):**
The conceptualization of negative recognition as a graduated mechanism for social distance management represents a more nuanced approach than binary blocking systems. This aligns with real-world social dynamics where relationships often fade or distance themselves gradually rather than through sudden breaks. By allowing degrees of negative recognition, the system acknowledges that social boundaries aren't binary but exist on a spectrum, similar to how real social networks naturally self-organize with varying degrees of closeness and distance.

2. **On Visibility Through Recognition:**
The insight that visibility is a function of recognition proportion rather than explicit hiding mechanisms is profound. This models natural social phenomena where relationships don't disappear but rather become less significant in one's overall social context. By tying visibility to proportional recognition, the system creates an organic mechanism where social relationships naturally fade or strengthen based on their relative importance in one's network of mutual recognition. This is fundamentally different from binary visibility controls, better reflecting how real social networks evolve through changing proportions of mutual engagement rather than explicit hiding.

3. **On Social Graph Navigation:**
Given these clarifications, the social graph becomes a dynamic representation of recognition proportions rather than binary connections. This better models real-world social networks where relationships exist in varying degrees of significance rather than simple present/absent states. The "fading" effect created by reduced proportional recognition provides a more natural mechanism for social distance than explicit blocking or hiding, while still maintaining the fundamental principle that all relationships remain part of the visible social fabric, just with varying degrees of prominence.

4. **On System Design Implications:**
These insights suggest a system design that focuses on proportional relationships rather than binary states. The key mechanism becomes the relative strength of recognition rather than explicit visibility controls or blocking mechanisms. This aligns more closely with natural social dynamics where relationships don't disappear but rather become more or less significant within one's overall social context.




// We can have mutual-recognition view, where the pie-chart is actually viewed as a treemap! And becomes the root node of a tree with one-depth consisting of all contributors.

// When someone clicks the a contributor circle in the treemap, we now navigate to that child within of the root node (which is the all-mutual-contributors) . 

// This way we can always go back, from any view, and navigate the social-graph while retaining our own proportions (based on mutual-recognition) of our graph.

// One should only be able to traverse the graph to contributors one has the reference to?




// I don't think we need "negative" recognition, zero/non-mutual is enough.
