WHO WE ARE

Playnet is a rapidly growing diverse network of activists, artists, coders, and researchers building open-source tools, frameworks, and economies for equitable resource distribution. We experiment with models that redistribute power and resources through mutual aid, trust, and collective creativity. We currently operate through a channel on telegram, regular meet-ups, spontaneous collaborations and play labs - combining in-person connection with online meetings and organizing with our contributors based around the world.A recent development, what we call “Free Association”, offers a crucial and timely alternative to capitalist structures by distributing capacities and resources (housing, skills, food, time) to those who need them through distributed, mutual-recognition networks. As multiple global crises intensify - from housing shortages to ecological breakdown and rising inequality - traditional economic models are proving fundamentally inadequate.

RECOGNITION-POWER

Something that has become clear to us in the course of our experimentation is that:

1. Money is a transferable form of social recognition and recognition-power.

It is a means of socially-validating and recognizing contributions.

It is the right to express social-value (through the medium of exchange: of course what can be valued in this frame is limited by what can be bought as commodity. Gifting money is the exception)

2. The transferability of recognition-power is what enables its accumulation. Which means that:

Recognition-power becomes concentrated in fewer hands over time

Those with concentrated recognition-power get to decide what has value

They naturally value things that protect their accumulated recognition (military, police, legal systems protecting property rights)

This reinforces the entire system that enabled their accumulation in the first place

As well as that when you work:

You receive a token of social recognition (money)

You must surrender this token to survive (buy food)

The shop owner accumulates your recognition

They can use this accumulated recognition to purchase your labor power (capacity-to-labor)

And the cycle repeats, resulting in ever larger inequality, and ever grosser disproportion between real contribution and recognition-power accumulation as ever larger masses of people find themselves with an ever smaller capacity to express their values, to organize social-production around the realization of what they value, and to validate the contribution of others.Money is not the only form of transferable recognition-power, this Titles passed down generationally are also forms of transferable recognition-power (this includes family-names!), so are many kinds of roles which transfer from person to person (kings, queens, presidents, etc.)

Free-Association offers a radical alternative by breaking this cycle through non-transferable recognition. When recognition can't be transferred or accumulated:

Each person retains 100% of their recognition power

No one can monopolize the power to determine what has value

Value can extend beyond commodities to anything that contributes to self-actualization

Power hierarchies based on accumulated recognition become impossible

In Free Association, validation of contributions happens through mutual recognition networks rather than through surrendering tokens of value. The recognition I give you for contributing to my self-actualization remains mine to give or redistribute, while simultaneously allowing you to be offered my capacities based on our mutual recognition.

This changes what society collectively values:

In market systems: Capacities realize primarily to what wealthy people want (luxury goods, military protection of assets, financial instruments)

In Free-Association: Capacities realize to whatever contributes to mutual self-actualization across the network (housing, food, education, community, environmental protection)

We believe this would transform our relationship with crucial issues like climate change, homelessness and inequality. Rather than being limited to expressing concern through purchasing air conditioners or carbon offsets (commodities), we could directly recognize and allocate capacities toward solving climate change itself or restoring ecological systems. The value isn't limited to what can be bought and sold.

THE GIFT ECONOMY SCALING PROBLEM

But there's an even deeper issue that underlies the recognition-power problem:

1. Gift economies work naturally at small scales but seem to break down at large scales.

At small scales, you naturally want to give your capacity toward your own mutual-fulfillment

You can easily use your capacity-distribution-determination-power to direct your capacity toward your own self-actualization

You know which contributions deserve recognition and which capacities would benefit you

Gift relationships feel natural and sustainable because the feedback loops are visible

2. At large scales, gift economies become overwhelming and seem impossible. Which means that:

You still want to distribute your capacity toward your own mutual-fulfillment

But at scale, it becomes overwhelming to use your capacity-distribution-determination-power effectively

Those with accumulated transferable recognition-power offer to solve this scaling problem for you

They promise that if you surrender your capacity-distribution-determination-power to them, they will use it efficiently

This creates the illusion that alienating your power is the only way to make it work at scale

As well as that when you need to survive:

You surrender your capacity-distribution-determination-power to those with accumulated recognition-power (money)

They direct your capacity toward their goals rather than your mutual-fulfillment

This reinforces the scaling problem by preventing you from learning how to use your power effectively

The cycle repeats, with ever larger masses of people surrendering their capacity-distribution-determination-power because they don't know how to use it at scale

Free-Association offers a radical alternative by solving the scaling problem while letting you keep your power. When you have a mathematical framework that allows you to distribute your capacity toward your own mutual-fulfillment at scale:

```
Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization
Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)

General-Share(You, Provider) = MR(You, Provider) / Σ MR(Provider, Each-of-Those-Provider-Recognizes)
```

Gift economies can work at any scale because the mathematical framework makes exercising your own capacity-distribution-determination-power workable at scale

You can distribute your capacity precisely toward your own mutual-fulfillment across networks

Your capacity flows toward whatever contributes to your own mutual-self-actualization

The scaling problem is solved without requiring you to surrender your capacity-distribution-determination-power to intermediary systems

In Free Association, you participate in gift economies that scale through mutual recognition networks. Your capacity flows based on your recognition of others' contributions to your self-actualization, while the mathematical framework ensures this works efficiently at any scale and for any capacity.

The mathematics ensures that false recognition naturally diminishes while true recognition strengthens:

```
For any participant:
Total Recognition = 100%
Total Recognition = True-Recognition + False-Recognition
   ∴ ↑False-Recognition = ↓True-Recognition
      ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Actually-Beneficial-Contributors
         ∴ ↓Shares of Actually-Beneficial-Capacities from Actually-Beneficial-Contributors
            ∴ ↓Real-Social-Material-Basis for Self-Actualization
```

This mathematical property ensures that your capacity flows toward what genuinely contributes to your mutual-fulfillment at scale.

This changes what your capacity collectively creates and supports:

In current systems: Your capacity flows primarily to what intermediary systems want (profit maximization, competitive advantage, institutional growth)

In Free-Association: Your capacity flows to whatever contributes to mutual self-actualization across the network (housing, food, education, community, environmental restoration)

This is why Free-Association is not just an economic system - it's a mathematical framework that solves the scaling problem for capacity-distribution-determination-power without requiring you to surrender that power to others.

CAPACITY-COMPOSITION

WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE WORK

Over the past three years, we’ve engaged hundreds of people globally through “play-labs” and grown to a community of 50 active contributors based around the world. Play-labs are effectively games where communities design and test systems for self-organized capacity distribution. Everything is documented and reincorporated into further developing our shared tools and practice. We operate transparently via Open Collective, where community sustains our core infrastructure.
