## 2. Definitions and Interpretive Framework

- **Code of Conduct**: The standards of behavior required of all Participants in Commons-related activities.
- **Data Retention Policy**: The formal policy specifying the retention periods and processes for Commons data.

### 2.3 Interpretive Principles

In interpreting this Agreement, the following principles shall apply:

- **Public-By-Default Principle**: All ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of public access, transparency, and openness of Contributions.
- **Technological Neutrality**: This Agreement shall be interpreted to accommodate evolving technologies while maintaining its fundamental principles.
- **Purposive Interpretation**: Provisions shall be interpreted in light of the purposes stated in Section 1 and the Commons' overall objectives.
- **Good Faith and Fair Dealing**: All rights and obligations shall be exercised and performed in good faith.

### 2.4 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [JURISDICTION], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [JURISDICTION] for any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, subject to the dispute resolution provisions herein.

### 2.5 Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

## 3. Public-By-Default Participation Framework

### 3.1 Explicit Public Contribution Consent

Participation in the Commons requires affirmative, explicit, and informed consent to the public nature of all Contributions. Each Participant hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and explicitly acknowledges and agrees that:

- ALL Contributions to the Commons are PUBLIC information;
- Contributions will be visible, accessible, and usable by anyone worldwide;
- There is NO expectation of confidentiality or privacy for any Contribution; and
- Once submitted, Contributions cannot be fully withdrawn from public visibility.

This consent constitutes a deliberate and informed choice to make organizational information public.

### 3.2 Educational Requirement

Prior to acceptance as a Participant, each individual or authorized organizational representative must complete a mandatory educational module that:

- Explicitly emphasizes the public, permanent nature of all Contributions;
- Requires explicit acknowledgment that NOTHING submitted should be considered confidential;
- Provides clear examples of information that should never be contributed (e.g., personal data, trade secrets, security credentials);
- Clarifies the distinction between Organizational Data (appropriate for contribution) and Personal Data (not appropriate unless explicitly designated as public professional information); and
- Demonstrates the economic and social value proposition of Commons participation.

### 3.3 Demonstration of Understanding

Participants must demonstrate comprehension of the public-by-default nature of the Commons through specific verifiable actions, including:

- Successful completion of a comprehension assessment specifically testing understanding of the public nature of all Contributions;
- Explicit acknowledgment that the Participant has read this entire Agreement;
- Initial supervised Contributions with feedback demonstrating appropriate content selection; and
- Clear confirmation that the Participant understands they should never contribute information they wish to keep private.

## 4. Public Data Designation

### 4.1 Bright-Line Public/Private Distinction

This Agreement establishes a clear, bright-line distinction:

- ALL Contributions to the Commons are irrevocably PUBLIC and may be freely accessed, used, and shared by anyone in accordance with the Data Commons License; and
- Personal Data shall NOT be contributed to the Commons unless it constitutes public professional information (such as work contact details) explicitly designated as public by the data subject.

If there is ANY doubt about whether information should be contributed, Participants must err on the side of non-contribution.

### 4.2 Public Resource Designation

All Contributions to the Commons are hereby irrevocably designated as public resources governed by the collective under the frameworks established in this Agreement. By making a Contribution, each Participant explicitly acknowledges and agrees that:

- The Contribution becomes part of the public Commons resource pool;
- Governance of the Contribution transitions from individual to collective stewardship;
- Rights to the Contribution are thereafter defined by this Agreement and the Data Commons License; and
- No individual proprietary claim may be asserted over the Contribution beyond the rights expressly reserved in this Agreement.

### 4.3 Attribution System

The Commons establishes protocols for appropriate attribution that recognize Contributions. Specifically, the attribution system shall:

- Operate through principles of Free-Association Economics, whereby recognition and economic value allocation occur through transparent, networked association mechanisms;
- Enable acknowledgment of organizational and individual Contributions where appropriate;
- Permit pseudonymous attribution when desired; and
- Facilitate the accrual of reputational and economic capital through Contribution patterns.
