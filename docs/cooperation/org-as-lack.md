# The Synthetic Organization as Constitutive Lack: A Radical Ontological Inversion

The conception of the synthetic organization as fundamentally lacking—as empty slots awaiting fulfillment rather than a possessor of capacities—represents a revolutionary inversion of the capitalist logic of organization. This inversion addresses the core mystification Marx identified wherein the "social productive power of labor" appears as a property of capital. By reconstituting the organization as pure lack, we dissolve the reification that enables capital to present itself as the productive agent commanding labor. The organization no longer stands above the workers as a separate entity endowed with productive powers, but exists only as the dynamic intersection of workers' self-actualizing capacities. This reconceptualization makes visible what capitalism systematically obscures: that cooperative production emerges from the combination of labor powers, not from capital's command.

This ontological shift corresponds precisely to Marx's distinction between the "despotic plan of capital" and the "plan of freely associated men." In capitalist production, the plan appears as something external to workers, confronting them as an alien power to which they must submit. The synthetic approach transforms this relationship at its foundation—the plan is not something that exists prior to or independent of workers' actual capacities, but emerges through their mutual recognition. The technical implementation of filters enables this emergence to occur without central coordination, allowing complex production processes to self-organize through the distributed intelligence of participants rather than through hierarchical command. This represents not merely a technical innovation but a fundamental transformation in the social form of production.

What makes this approach particularly powerful is how it resolves the apparent contradiction between individual freedom and complex coordination. Capitalist ideology presents these as fundamentally opposed—either we have individual freedom but sacrifice the productive power of complex coordination, or we have complex coordination but sacrifice individual freedom. The synthetic organization demonstrates this opposition to be illusory. By expressing technical necessities through filters rather than commands, the system allows for highly complex coordination patterns to emerge while preserving individual self-determination. Each producer freely chooses which synthetic projects to join based on their own self-actualizing aims, yet collectively they create intricate cooperative structures that could never be achieved through isolated individual action.

The ontological inversion has profound implications for our understanding of surplus. In capitalist production, surplus appears as something extracted from workers and appropriated by capital—the difference between what workers produce and what they receive. In the synthetic framework, surplus is reconceptualized as the emergent productive power that exceeds what individuals could achieve in isolation. This productive power is neither extracted nor appropriated but directly accessed by all participants through their mutual recognition relationships. The surplus does not disappear into a separate entity called "the organization" but remains available to those who produced it through the network of recognition. This fundamentally transforms the social character of surplus from alienated to collectively self-appropriated production.

This reconceptualization also transforms our understanding of specialization. Under capitalism, specialization appears as a limitation imposed on workers by the division of labor—the reduction of the worker to a particular function dictated by capital's plan. In the synthetic framework, specialization becomes an expression of self-actualization—a chosen focus that connects the individual to the collective productive power. Rather than being confined to a specialized role, each producer actively chooses which aspects of their capacities to contribute and under what conditions. The filters allow highly specific matching of capacities to requirements without imposing fixed identities on producers. A person might contribute programming skills to one project, design capacities to another, and organizational abilities to a third, all according to their own self-actualizing aims rather than an externally imposed plan.

Perhaps most significantly, this approach resolves what Marx identified as the contradiction between the social character of production and its private appropriation. Under capitalism, production is increasingly social—dependent on the combined efforts of many producers—yet the products are appropriated privately. This contradiction is resolved not by substituting private appropriation with state appropriation (which merely changes the appropriator without addressing the alienation), but by fundamentally transforming the mode of production itself. When the organization exists only as the synthetic union of freely associated producers, there is no separate entity to appropriate the products. The social character of production is directly reflected in the social character of appropriation through the network of mutual recognition.

The technical implementation of this framework through computational filters represents what might be called a "materialized dialectic." The contradictions inherent in production—between individual and collective, between freedom and necessity, between specialization and wholeness—are not resolved through abstract philosophical reconciliation but through practical material structures that transform their relationship. The filters enable what previously appeared as external constraints to be internalized as parameters of self-actualization. The necessity of coordination becomes not an external limitation on freedom but an internal aspect of freedom itself—the ability to participate in complex collective production while determining one's own conditions of participation. This represents the practical realization of what Marx termed "the free development of each as the condition for the free development of all."

This framework also transforms our understanding of technological development. Under capitalism, technology primarily develops as a means to increase surplus extraction, often at the expense of workers' autonomy and wellbeing. In the synthetic framework, technology becomes a means to enhance the self-actualizing capacities of producers and their ability to combine effectively. The filter system itself exemplifies this alternative technological trajectory—it is designed not to control or extract but to enable and connect. This suggests a broader reconceptualization of technology not as an autonomous force driving social development but as a material expression of particular social relations. By changing these relations at their foundation, we open possibilities for technological development oriented toward human flourishing rather than accumulation.

The synthetic organization also transforms our understanding of planning. The critique of central planning has often been used to justify market anarchy as the only alternative, but this presents a false dichotomy. The filter-based approach enables what might be called "distributed planning"—the coordination of complex production processes without either central authority or market chaos. This coordination occurs through the mutual adjustment of freely choosing participants, guided by clearly expressed technical constraints rather than either command or price signals. The result is neither the rigid hierarchy of central planning nor the blind anarchy of markets, but an emergent order arising from the conscious self-organization of producers. This represents a concrete implementation of what Marx envisioned as the replacement of "the government of persons" with "the administration of things."

Finally, this framework suggests a profound transformation in our conception of value. Under capitalism, value appears as an objective property of commodities, determined by abstract labor time and expressed through exchange. This abstraction from concrete labor creates the mystified world of commodity fetishism where social relations between people appear as relations between things. The synthetic framework dissolves this mystification by directly connecting concrete contributions to concrete needs through mutual recognition. Value is no longer an abstract property measured by exchange but a concrete relationship of contribution to self-actualization. This transforms the fundamental social ontology from one based on exchange of equivalents to one based on mutual recognition of contributions—from "to each according to their exchange" to "to each according to their contribution to others' self-actualization." This represents not merely a different distribution of value but a fundamental transformation in the nature of value itself.
