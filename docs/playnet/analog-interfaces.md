## Colored Water Distribution

### Components
- **Personal Base Container**: A clear, flat, portable container with 100ml capacity, marked with measurement lines
- **Contributor Vials**: Set of 5-10 smaller clear vials with tight-sealing caps, labeled with erasable markers
- **Colored Dye**: Personalized color for each individual (represents their unique contribution)
- **Measuring Pipette**: For precise adjustment of water distribution
- **Portable Carrying Case**: Protective case with compartments for all components

### How It Works
1. **Setup**:
   - Fill your base container with exactly 100ml of water
   - Add your personal colored dye to make it distinctly yours
   - Identify contributors to your self-actualization (people, communities, activities)
   - Label each vial with a contributor's name using the erasable marker

2. **Recognition Distribution**:
   - Distribute your 100ml of colored water among the contributor vials
   - The percentage of water allocated represents your recognition of their contribution
   - Example: 35ml to your community garden (35%), 25ml to your mentor (25%), etc.
   - Ensure the sum equals 100ml (100% of your total recognition)

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - As your recognition changes, use the pipette to redistribute water
   - Erase and relabel vials as contributors change in your life
   - New contributors can receive water from your base container or redistributed from others

4. **Observing Mutual Recognition**:
   - When meeting another person, place your vial of their water next to their vial of your water
   - Compare the volumes - the smaller amount represents your mutual recognition
   - Example: If you gave them 30ml and they gave you 20ml, your mutual recognition is 20%

5. **Visualization of Network Effects**:
   - During gatherings, place all related vials in a pattern to see recognition flows
   - Create "watersheds" of mutual recognition by arranging vials in flowing patterns
   - Watch how adjustments in one relationship affect the entire ecosystem

### Practical Considerations
- Use unbreakable, lightweight plastic containers for portability
- Include measurement marks for precise allocation
- Seal containers tightly for transport between locations
- Use biodegradable, non-toxic dyes for safety
- Optional digital component: photo documentation of distributions to track changes over time

### Variations
- **Seasonal Colors**: Change your base dye color seasonally to track changes over time
- **Layered Recognition**: Use oil and water to represent different types of contributions
- **Merged Recognition**: Special container for combining water from multiple people who are part of the same project/community
