We want to reformulate capacity composition as a specialized Multi-Commodity-Flow Problem using Glpk.md through the lense of composing shares into capacities

currently i am thinking about how to compose quantities/percentages of shares into capacities which have functions that define the quanitity output given certain combination of inputs.

These function should search a matrix of input quantites and output quantities, at different ratios and compositions of input quantities / relations / compositions

Please reflect on this approach in depth 10 paragraphs

I am wondering how this could lead to a reframing of the multi-commodity-flow problem (especially given that in free-association shares/capacities are not capacites, yet they are still composed)

Looking at your schema and the concept of composing shares into capacities through functional mappings, I see a fascinating approach that fundamentally challenges traditional resource allocation models. Your idea of using functions that search matrices of input/output quantities at different ratios represents a shift from static capacity constraints to dynamic compositional relationships. This approach recognizes that the "capacity" of a system isn't fixed but emerges from the specific combinations and ratios of constituent shares, much like how chemical reactions produce different yields based on reactant ratios and conditions.

The matrix-based search mechanism you're describing suggests a form of combinatorial optimization where each cell in the matrix represents a potential composition state. These functions would essentially be performing a kind of "yield optimization" - given a set of input shares with their respective quantities and percentages, what are all the possible output capacities that could be generated, and at what efficiency ratios? This is particularly intriguing because it moves beyond simple additive models (where 2 + 2 = 4) to explore synergistic and catalytic relationships where certain combinations might produce emergent capacities that exceed the sum of their parts.

The search across different ratios and compositions implies that your system recognizes non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. This could capture phenomena like economies of scale, network effects, or even threshold effects where certain minimum combinations are required before any meaningful capacity emerges. For instance, a housing capacity might require not just physical space but also coordination capacity, trust relationships, and logistical support - and the function would search for the optimal ratio of these inputs to maximize the effective housing output.

What's particularly compelling about this approach is how it handles the inherent uncertainty and contextual variability in real-world resource sharing. Rather than assuming fixed conversion rates, the matrix search allows for discovering context-dependent optimal compositions. A cooking capacity might have different input/output ratios depending on whether it's being used for individual meals versus community gatherings, and your functions could discover these contextual variations through the matrix exploration.

The integration with your recognition cache system adds another layer of sophistication - the functions aren't just optimizing for mathematical efficiency but are also considering the social and relational aspects of capacity composition. The "ourShare" and "theirShare" percentages in your recognition cache could influence the matrix search, biasing it toward compositions that align with established relationship patterns and mutual recognition dynamics.

Regarding the multi-commodity-flow problem reframing, your insight about shares/capacities not being traditional "capacities" is crucial. In classical multi-commodity-flow, we have fixed capacities on edges and known demands at nodes. But in your system, the "capacities" are themselves emergent properties of share compositions. This suggests a meta-level flow problem where the flow itself is determining the capacity of the edges through which it flows - a kind of self-organizing network topology.

This reframing could lead to what we might call a "compositional flow problem" where instead of routing commodities through fixed capacity networks, we're simultaneously optimizing both the flow paths and the capacity configurations that emerge from share compositions. The network edges don't have predetermined capacities; instead, they have compositional functions that generate capacities based on the shares flowing through them and their current composition states.

The temporal dimension adds further complexity - your matrix search functions would need to consider not just static optimal compositions but also dynamic sequences of compositions over time. A capacity might be optimally composed one way in the morning and differently in the evening, or might benefit from periodic "recomposition" to maintain efficiency. This suggests a multi-temporal optimization problem where the functions are searching not just across spatial compositions but also across temporal composition sequences.

The social dimension of your free-association system introduces constraints and objectives that don't exist in traditional multi-commodity-flow problems. The matrix search must consider not just efficiency but also equity, relationship sustainability, and community coherence. This could lead to multi-objective optimization where the functions are simultaneously optimizing for capacity output, relationship health, and systemic sustainability.

Finally, this approach opens up possibilities for emergent capacity discovery - where the matrix search functions might discover entirely new types of capacities that arise from unexpected share combinations. Rather than just optimizing known capacity types, the system could be continuously discovering new forms of collective capability that emerge from novel compositions of available shares. This transforms the multi-commodity-flow problem from a routing and allocation problem into a creative discovery process that's constantly expanding the possibility space of what can be achieved through collaboration.


// Simple Composition Matrix Definition
type CompositionMatrix = {
	[inputComposition: string]: {
		[outputType: string]: {
			ratio: number;
			quantity: number;
		};
	};
};

// Input composition key format: "input1:qty1,input2:qty2,..."
// Example: "housing:100,coordination:50,trust:30"

// Usage example:
const matrix: CompositionMatrix = {
	'housing:100,coordination:50': {
		housing_network: { ratio: 0.8, quantity: 80 },
		community_space: { ratio: 0.6, quantity: 60 }
	},
	'coordination:50,trust:30': {
		facilitation: { ratio: 1.2, quantity: 36 },
		mediation: { ratio: 0.9, quantity: 27 }
	}
};

// Search function
function searchMatrix(
	inputs: Record<string, number>,
	matrix: CompositionMatrix
): Array<{ outputType: string; ratio: number; quantity: number }> {
	const inputKey = Object.entries(inputs)
		.map(([type, qty]) => `${type}:${qty}`)
		.sort()
		.join(',');

	const outputs = matrix[inputKey];
	if (!outputs) return [];

	return Object.entries(outputs).map(([outputType, result]) => ({
		outputType,
		...result
	}));
