# Playnet Free-Association Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to creating a community where the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all. This Code of Conduct reflects our values of mutual recognition, voluntary participation, and harm reduction.

## Core Principles

### Enthusiastic Consent & Voluntary Participation

- **Relations activate only through mutual desire and consent**
- Active, ongoing agreement is valued over mere absence of refusal
- All participation is voluntary - no coercion or pressure
- Boundaries are respected immediately and without question

### Mutual Recognition & Non-Ownership

- We recognize and acknowledge contributions to each other's development
- **No one owns anyone else** - we each own 100% of ourselves
- Recognition can be adjusted based on current contributions and changing relationships
- We prioritize reciprocal relationships where recognition flows both ways

### Inclusivity & Self-Determination

- We embrace diverse bodies, identities, orientations, and relationship structures
- Each person has the right to define their own identity and desires
- We actively work to eliminate harmful social stigmas around desire and expression
- Bodily autonomy and self-determination are fundamental rights

### Honest Communication & Power Consciousness

- We prioritize transparent expression of needs, desires, and boundaries
- We acknowledge and address power differentials in all relationships
- We communicate directly and kindly about conflicts or concerns
- We focus on understanding rather than winning arguments

### Harm Reduction & Shame Rejection

- We focus on minimizing potential negative consequences without judgment
- We actively work against systems of oppression and harmful power structures
- We reject shame-based approaches to community standards
- We prioritize learning and growth over punishment

## Community Standards

### Encouraged Behaviors

- Contributing to others' self-actualization through skills, resources, or recognition
- Sharing knowledge and resources according to your capacity
- Engaging in stigmergic coordination - indirect collaboration through shared environments
- Providing constructive feedback that helps others grow
- Celebrating diverse approaches to the same problems
- Acknowledging when you don't know something or make mistakes

### Unacceptable Behaviors

- Any form of harassment, discrimination, or targeted attacks
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing private information without consent
- Attempts to control or own others through debt, obligation, or coercion
- Persistent disregard for clearly stated boundaries
- Behavior that creates hostile environments for marginalized community members

## Enforcement

### Graduated Response System

Following our values of harm reduction and restorative justice:

1. **Direct Communication**: Community members are encouraged to address issues directly when safe and appropriate
2. **Mediation**: Facilitated dialogue between parties when direct communication isn't sufficient
3. **Temporary Limits**: Time-limited restrictions on participation to allow for reflection and learning
4. **Community Decision**: Collective decision-making for serious or persistent violations
5. **Separation**: Removal from community spaces as a last resort for safety

### Reporting

- Report violations to [ruzgar@playnet.lol] or through private channels
- All reports will be handled with confidentiality and care
- Reporters will not face retaliation for good-faith reports
- Community members experiencing harassment will receive support

## Conflict Resolution

We believe in transformative rather than punitive approaches to conflict:

- **Focus on needs/desires**: Understanding underlying needs rather than positions
- **Restorative processes**: Repairing harm and rebuilding relationships when possible
- **Community learning**: Using conflicts as opportunities for collective growth
- **Multiple options**: Providing various pathways for resolution based on what works for those involved

## Continuous Adaptation

This Code of Conduct is a living document that evolves with our community. We regularly review and update it based on:

- Community feedback and learning
- Changing conditions and new challenges
- Better understanding of how to create truly inclusive spaces
- Alignment with our evolving values and practices

## Connection to Free-Association Values

This Code of Conduct embodies our commitment to creating systems where:

- Individual freedom connects to collective liberation
- Surplus flows to those who contribute to our mutual flourishing
- Recognition remains dynamic and responsive to present reality
- Power is distributed rather than concentrated
- Communities self-organize around shared values rather than imposed rules
