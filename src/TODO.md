- Currently our update header is not working with resizes during zoomins/zoomouts! It seems to only work for the root level prior to zooming in / zooming out!
- Lets find a more elegant way of doing header resizing that scales with the treeMap instead of independantly of it!

For Today:
- Get tags working on type-map
- Get mutual-recognition working!

- The names in the tags and of the root user seem to not be resolving to the names, and instead keep using IDs.
- Is mutual-recognition calculating properly?

- make colors persist across sessions! (So users can also change the colors!)
