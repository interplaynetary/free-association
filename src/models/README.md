# Reactive Gun Implementation

This implementation follows the principles laid out in the Gun guide, focusing on reactive data handling and proper abstractions.

## Core Classes

### GunSubscription

A wrapper around Gun subscriptions with these key benefits:
- Uses ReadableStream for proper reactive data flow
- Handles subscription cleanup automatically
- Provides error handling and timeout protection
- Prevents data leaks by checking subscription status before emitting events
- Allows mapping and iterating over collections

### GunNode

A base class for working with Gun nodes that:
- Provides a consistent API for Gun operations
- Handles parameter cloning to prevent option mutation
- Exposes methods for reactive data handling
- Creates strongly typed access to Gun data
- Provides utilities for navigating the graph

### TreeNodeReactive

A fully reactive implementation of the TreeNode model that:
- Treats all Gun data as reactive streams
- Maintains a minimalistic local cache that's driven by Gun data
- Properly manages subscriptions to prevent memory leaks
- Efficiently handles parent-child relationships in the reactive paradigm
- Implements the full TreeNode API with proper reactivity

## Key Improvements Over Previous Implementation

1. **True Reactivity**: Data flows from Gun to the application in a reactive way, with proper subscriptions and cleanup.

2. **Reduced Cache Complexity**: Instead of maintaining complex static caches, we use a registry pattern that's driven by Gun data.

3. **Simpler Subscription Model**: All subscriptions are handled through a consistent API with proper lifecycle management.

4. **Proper Error Handling**: Prevents hanging promises, deals with missing data gracefully, and includes timeouts.

5. **Memory Safety**: Better cleanup of resources when nodes are no longer needed.

6. **Simplified Code**: More consistent patterns and less code duplication.

## Usage

To use the new implementation:

```typescript
// Get an existing node
const node = TreeNode.getNode('node-id', app);

// Create a new node
const newNode = await TreeNode.create('Node Name', {
  parent: parentNode,
  points: 10,
  typeIds: ['type1', 'type2']
}, app);

// Use reactive properties
node.on(data => {
  console.log(`Node updated: ${data.name}`);
});

// All the same methods and properties as before
node.addChild('Child Name');
node.addType('type-id');
console.log(node.fulfilled);
```

## Guide Principles Implemented

1. **Treat data as streams**: Using the `on` method and ReadableStream for subscription.
2. **Proper cleanup**: Unsubscribing when data is no longer needed.
3. **Avoiding Gun promise pitfalls**: Using proper await patterns with timeouts.
4. **Simplifying iteration**: Using the `each` method for collections.
5. **Better structure**: Using wrapper classes for cleaner abstractions.

This implementation creates a more reliable, maintainable foundation for the Tree Model while maintaining compatibility with the existing API.
