HyperArcs Zod Schema (with Contexts)

general.md but for deriving:
mutual-relation
common-relations (relation -> list of those that share it)


Desire expression:
source: capacity
target: capacity
predicate: compose_from_source_into_target

Currently i think we divide from and into
Is this division necessary?

It kind of makes sense:

Mutual-Recognition of Object-Attributes

Common-Recognition of Object-Attributes
