- Fixed-point: `N⃗* = 0⃗`
- Theorems: 1-9 proven

**Use Cases:**
- Single-commodity systems
- Time-sharing platforms
- Simple resource pools
- Prototype implementations

## Multi-Dimensional Extension

**File:** `multi-dimensional.md`

**Properties:**
- Vector needs: `N⃗_i(t) ∈ ℝ^m`
- Per-type contraction: `||N⃗^k(t+1)|| ≤ k_k||N⃗^k(t)||`
- Frobenius norm contraction: `||N⃗⃗(t+1)||_F ≤ k_max||N⃗⃗(t)||_F`
- Fixed-point: `N⃗⃗* = 0⃗⃗`
- Theorems: 10-13 proven

**New Features:**
- Provider specialization
- Type-specific recognition
- Independent convergence per type
- Substitutable/complementary needs
- Cross-type aggregation

**Use Cases:**
- Healthcare (diagnostics, consultation, surgery)

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Single Type
Start with scalar implementation:
```typescript
interface Need {
  quantity: number;
}
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Type
Extend to vectors:
```typescript
interface Need {
  type: number;        // k ∈ {1,...,m}
  quantity: number;
}
```

### Phase 3: Specialization
Add per-type recognition:
```typescript
interface Recognition {
  byType: Map<number, number>;  // k → weight
  aggregate: number;
}
```

### 🔮 Future Extensions

#### Hierarchical Types
```
Food
├── Produce
│   ├── Vegetables
│   └── Fruits
└── Grains
    ├── Wheat
    └── Rice
```

#### Dynamic Types
Types can emerge/disappear:
```
T(t) ⊆ {1, 2, ..., M}
```

#### Coupled Constraints
Cross-type dependencies:
```
N_i^housing ≤ f(N_i^location, N_i^construction)
```

#### Exchange Rates
Type substitution with conversion:
```
N_i^effective = Σ_k e_k × N_i^k(t)
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Independence Preserves Contraction

Each need type evolves independently:
```
∂N_i^k/∂t is independent of N_i^l for k ≠ l
```

Therefore:
```
||N⃗⃗(t+1)||_F² = Σ_k ||N⃗^k(t+1)||²
                ≤ Σ_k k_k² ||N⃗^k(t)||²
                ≤ k_max² ||N⃗⃗(t)||_F²
```

### 2. Specialization Improves Efficiency

With type-specific recognition:
- Providers focus on expertise
- Recognition weights reflect skill
- Allocation matches capability

### 3. Parallel Convergence

Each type converges independently:
```
Food:      ||N⃗^food(t)|| → 0 at rate k_food
Healthcare: ||N⃗^health(t)|| → 0 at rate k_health
Education:  ||N⃗^edu(t)|| → 0 at rate k_edu
```

System converges at slowest rate: `k_max = max{k_food, k_health, k_edu}`

## Practical Examples

### Single Provider, Multiple Types

```
Provider: Community Generalist
Needs: [Food=20, Shelter=10, Care=15]
Capacity: [Food=30, Shelter=5, Care=20]

Allocation per type:
- Food: min(30, 20) = 20 ✅ Fully satisfied
- Shelter: min(5, 10) = 5 ⚠️ Partial
- Care: min(20, 15) = 15 ✅ Fully satisfied

Result: N⃗ = [0, 5, 0] (shelter remains)
```

### Multiple Providers, Specialization

```
Recipient: N⃗ = [Food=50, Healthcare=20]

Provider 1 (Food Specialist):
- C⃗ = [100, 0]
- Allocates: A⃗ = [50, 0] (full food)

Provider 2 (Healthcare Specialist):
- C⃗ = [0, 30]
- Allocates: A⃗ = [0, 20] (full healthcare)

Result: N⃗ = [0, 0] ✅ All needs met
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalar System
- **Space:** O(n) for need vector
- **Time:** O(n²) for allocation
- **Convergence:** ~5-20 iterations

### Multi-Dimensional System

- **Convergence:** ~5-20 iterations per type (can be parallel)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Parallel processing** - Each type independent
2. **Sparse types** - Skip zero-capacity types
3. **Specialized networks** - Type-specific MR graphs
