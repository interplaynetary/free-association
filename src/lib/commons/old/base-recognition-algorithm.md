# Base Recognition Economy Algorithm

## Core Definitions

```
Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization

Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = 
    minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, 
            Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)
```

## Share Calculations

```
General-Share(You, Provider) = 
    MR(You, Provider) / Σ MR(Provider, Each-of-Those-Provider-Recognizes)

Specific-Share(You, Provider, Capacity) = 
    General-Share(You, Provider) × Filter(You, Capacity) / 
    Σ (General-Share(Each-Filtered-Participant, Provider) × Filter(Each-Filtered-Participant, Capacity))

where Filter(Participant, Capacity) = 
    1 if Participant satisfies Capacity's filter criteria
    0 otherwise
```

## Allocation Process

```
Allocation(You, Provider, Capacity) = Mutual-Fulfillment-Allocation(You, Provider, Capacity)

where Mutual-Fulfillment-Allocation is calculated as:

1. Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, You) = 
       minimum(Your-Desire-From-Provider, Provider-Desire-Into-You)

2. Mutually-Desiring-Recipients = 
       {Recipient | Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient) > 0}

3. Normalized-MR-Share(You, Provider) = 
       MR(Provider, You) / Σ MR(Provider, Each-Mutually-Desiring-Recipient)

4. Raw-Allocation(You, Provider, Capacity) = 
       Capacity.quantity × Normalized-MR-Share(You, Provider)

5. Final-Allocation(You, Provider, Capacity) = 
       minimum(Raw-Allocation(You, Provider, Capacity), 
               Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, You))

6. Redistribute any unused capacity among unsatisfied mutually-desiring recipients
```

## Characteristics

**Computation Type:** Single-pass, deterministic

**Coordination:** None required (each provider allocates independently)

**Optimization Goal:** Allocate capacity proportionally to mutual-recognition while respecting mutual-desire

**Limitations:**
- Does not account for quantifiable needs (only desires/preferences)
- No mechanism to prevent over-allocation when multiple providers contribute
- No coordination between providers serving same recipient
- Cannot optimize for global need fulfillment

## Comparison to Other Algorithms

### vs. Need-Fulfillment Extension
- **Base algorithm:** One-shot allocation based on MR and mutual-desire
- **Need-Fulfillment:** Iterative multi-round convergence to optimize need satisfaction

### vs. Sequential State Publication (Option 2)
- **Base algorithm:** No state publication mechanism
- **Sequential:** Recipients publish allocation states, providers allocate in order

### Key Advancement
The base algorithm provides the foundation for capacity allocation based on recognition, but requires extension to handle concrete needs and multi-provider coordination.
