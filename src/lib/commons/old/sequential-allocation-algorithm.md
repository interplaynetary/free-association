# Sequential State Publication Algorithm (Option 2)

## Core Concepts (Unchanged from Base)

```
Your Recognition = your acknowledgment of contributions towards your own self-actualization

Your Total-Recognition = 100%

Mutual-Recognition(You, Them) = MR(You, Them) = 
    minimum(Their-share-of-Your-total-recognition, 
            Your-share-of-Their-total-recognition)
```

---

## Need Declaration

```
Recipient declares:
    Need(Type, Quantity) for each resource they require
```

---

## Sequential Processing with Live State Updates

### Setup

```
1. All providers and recipients publish:
   - MR(Provider, Recipient) values
   - Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient) values
   - Recipient.stated-need(Need-Type)

2. Deterministic ordering established (e.g., providers sorted by hash(Provider-ID))
```

---

### Allocation Process

```
For each Provider in deterministic order:
   
   For each Capacity owned by Provider:
   
     Mutually-Desiring-Recipients = {
       Recipient | Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient) > 0
     }
     
     For each Recipient in Mutually-Desiring-Recipients:
       
       Adjusted-Need(Recipient) = max(0, 
         Recipient.stated-need - Recipient.current-satisfaction
       )
       
       Effective-Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient) = 
         min(
           Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient),
           Adjusted-Need(Recipient)
         )
     
     # Allocate using normalized MR shares on adjusted desires
     
     Total-Weighted-Desire = Σ (
       MR(Provider, Recipient) × 
       Effective-Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient)
     )
     
     For each Recipient:
       Allocation(Recipient, Provider, Capacity) = 
         Capacity.quantity × 
         (MR(Provider, Recipient) × Effective-Mutual-Desire(...)) / 
         Total-Weighted-Desire
       
       # Update recipient's state IMMEDIATELY
       Recipient.current-satisfaction += Allocation(...)
```

---

## Key Mechanism

### Live State Updates

```
Recipient.current-satisfaction(Need-Type) = 
    Σ Confirmed-Allocations-So-Far
    
Adjusted-Need(Recipient, Need-Type) = 
    max(0, Recipient.stated-need - Recipient.current-satisfaction)
```

**Critical difference from base algorithm:** Each provider sees the cumulative allocations from all previous providers in the ordering.

---

## Properties

✅ **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same outputs (due to ordering)

✅ **Locally computable**: Each provider only needs:
- Their own MR values
- Recipients' current satisfaction (public, updated live)
- Their own capacity

✅ **Respects MR priorities**: Higher MR providers allocate proportionally more

✅ **Single pass**: No iteration required

❌ **NOT globally optimal**: Order-dependent outcomes

❌ **Order bias**: Early providers have "first pick" advantage

---

## The Order-Dependence Problem

### Example Scenario

```
Recipient R needs 500 money
Provider A (processed first): capacity=1000, MR(A,R)=0.3
Provider B (processed second): capacity=400, MR(B,R)=0.9
```

### What Happens

```
Step 1: Provider A allocates
    Adjusted-Need(R) = 500
    A allocates: min(1000, 500) = 500
    R.current-satisfaction = 500

Step 2: Provider B allocates
    Adjusted-Need(R) = 500 - 500 = 0
    B allocates: 0
    R.current-satisfaction = 500
```

### The Problem

- Provider A (low MR=0.3) fully satisfied R
- Provider B (high MR=0.9) allocated nothing
- **Not globally optimal**: B should have contributed more, A less
- **Outcome depends on processing order**

---

## Potential Mitigations

### Random Ordering Per Period

```
Each allocation period:
    Shuffle provider order randomly
    Run sequential algorithm
    
Over many periods, order bias averages out
```

**Limitation:** Single-period outcomes still suboptimal

---

### Weighted Ordering

```
Process providers in order of:
    - Lowest total capacity first (give scarce providers priority)
    - OR: Lowest average MR first (let low-priority fill gaps)
    - OR: Random weighted by inverse capacity
```

**Limitation:** Still order-dependent, just "better" ordering

---

## Use Cases

### When Sequential Works Well

1. **Real-time streaming**: Allocations arrive continuously, can't wait for batch
2. **Simplicity paramount**: Single-pass easier to implement/understand
3. **Order fairness acceptable**: Can randomize order each period
4. **Small networks**: Order effects less pronounced with few providers

### When to Avoid

1. **Global optimality required**: Use multi-round convergence instead
2. **High MR variance**: Order bias becomes significant
3. **Large networks**: Unfairness compounds
4. **Static order**: Same providers always processed first

## Comparison to Other Algorithms

### vs. Base Recognition Algorithm
- **Base:** No need tracking, allocates to raw mutual-desire
- **Sequential:** Tracks needs, adjusts based on current satisfaction
- **Advantage:** Prevents over-allocation
- **Disadvantage:** Introduces order bias

### vs. Need-Fulfillment (Multi-Round)
- **Need-Fulfillment:** Iterative, parallel, globally optimal
- **Sequential:** Single-pass, ordered, locally greedy
- **Advantage:** Simpler, faster (one pass)
- **Disadvantage:** Not globally optimal, order-dependent

---

## Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(P × C × R)
    P = number of providers
    C = capacities per provider
    R = recipients per capacity
    
Single pass, no iteration

Space Complexity: O(R)
    Only need current satisfaction states
```

Compare to multi-round:
- **Sequential:** 1 pass, order-dependent
- **Multi-round:** N passes (typically 5-10), order-independent

---

## Summary

**In one sentence:** The sequential algorithm processes providers in deterministic order, with each provider seeing the cumulative allocations from all previous providers and adjusting their allocations to remaining needs, resulting in a simple single-pass solution that prevents over-allocation but produces order-dependent outcomes.

---

## When to Use

**Choose Sequential when:**
- Simplicity > optimality
- Real-time processing required
- Can tolerate order effects
- Small network size

**Choose Multi-Round when:**
- Global optimality required
- Fair treatment of all providers
- Batch processing acceptable
- Provable convergence needed
