# Algorithm Optimizations

This document describes performance optimizations for the Need-Fulfillment Extension algorithm.

---

## Base Algorithm Performance

**Without optimizations:**
- Convergence: 10-20 rounds typical
- Computation: O(P × C × R) per round, serial
- Network: Full state broadcast every round
- Typical time (1000 actors): 10-60 seconds

**With Tier 1 optimizations:**
- Convergence: 3-8 rounds typical
- Computation: Fully parallelized + vectorized
- Network: Delta updates only
- Typical time (1000 actors): 1-5 seconds

---

## Tier 1: Essential Optimizations (Must-Have)

### 1. Per-Recipient Adaptive Damping

**Impact:** 2-3x faster convergence  
**Complexity:** 5 lines of code  

#### Formula
```
Over-Allocation-History[Need-Type].append(Over-Allocation[Need-Type])
Keep only last 3 values

Oscillation-Pattern = (value[0] < value[1] > value[2]) OR 
                      (value[0] > value[1] < value[2])

If Oscillation-Pattern:
    Damping-Factor[Need-Type] = 0.5  # Slow down
    
Else if Monotonically-Decreasing:
    Damping-Factor[Need-Type] = 1.0  # Full speed
    
Else:
    Damping-Factor[Need-Type] = 0.8  # Moderate
```

#### Why It Works
- Detects when providers are over-correcting
- Automatically slows down to prevent oscillation
- Speeds up when converging smoothly
- Per-recipient (not global), so adapts to local dynamics

#### Implementation Note
Requires recipients to track 3-round history of over-allocation values per need-type.

---

### 2. Early Termination per Recipient

**Impact:** 30-50% reduction in computation  
**Complexity:** 2 lines of code

#### Formula
```
Converged[Recipient, Need-Type] = (
    Over-Allocation[Need-Type] < ε AND
    Under-Allocation[Need-Type] < ε
)

Mutually-Desiring-Recipients = {
    Recipient | Mutual-Desire(Provider-Capacity, Recipient) > 0
                AND NOT Recipient.Converged[Need-Type]
}
```

#### Why It Works
- Recipients converge at different rates
- No point recalculating for converged recipients
- In later rounds, most recipients converged → skip majority of work

#### Implementation Note
Providers check convergence status before including recipient in allocation calculation.

---

### 3. Vectorized Computation

**Impact:** 10-100x faster computation  
**Complexity:** Use numpy/vectorization library

#### Scalar (Original)
```python
total_weighted = 0
for recipient in recipients:
    mr = self.MR[recipient]
    desire = effective_desires[recipient]
    total_weighted += mr * desire

for recipient in recipients:
    allocation = (capacity * mr * desire) / total_weighted
```

#### Vectorized (Optimized)
```python
import numpy as np

mr_values = np.array([self.MR[r] for r in recipients])
desires = np.array([effective_desires[r] for r in recipients])

# Single vectorized operation
total_weighted = np.sum(mr_values * desires)
allocations = (capacity * mr_values * desires) / total_weighted
```

#### Why It Works
- CPU vector instructions process arrays in parallel
- Eliminates Python loop overhead
- Leverages optimized BLAS libraries
- 10-100x speedup for large recipient sets (>100)

---

## Tier 2: High-Value Optimizations

### 4. Publish Only Changes

**Impact:** 50-90% reduction in network traffic  
**Complexity:** Moderate (need state diffing)

#### Formula
```
For each Recipient, each round:
    
    Current-State = {satisfaction, over-allocation, under-allocation, damping}
    Previous-State = state from Round N-1
    
    Delta = {k: v for k, v in Current-State if v ≠ Previous-State[k]}
    
    If Delta is not empty:
        Publish(Recipient-ID, Delta)
    Else:
        # No change, publish nothing
```

#### Why It Works
- Most recipients converge early
- Converged recipients have no state changes
- Only transmit what changed
- Network I/O is often the bottleneck at scale

---

### 5. Lazy State Fetching

**Impact:** 70-90% fewer state reads  
**Complexity:** Simple caching

#### Formula
```
Provider maintains:
    Recipient-State-Cache[Recipient-ID] = cached state
    Cache-Version[Recipient-ID] = version number

When calculating allocations:
    
    For each relevant Recipient:
        Ledger-Version = PublicLedger.get_version(Recipient-ID)
        
        If Ledger-Version ≠ Cache-Version[Recipient-ID]:
            # State changed, fetch it
            State = PublicLedger.get_state(Recipient-ID)
            Cache[Recipient-ID] = State
            Cache-Version[Recipient-ID] = Ledger-Version
        
        # Use cached state
        Use Cache[Recipient-ID]
```

#### Why It Works
- Converged recipients don't change state
- No need to re-fetch unchanged states
- Reduces read operations exponentially in later rounds

---

### 6. Batch Allocation Messages

**Impact:** ~10x reduction in message overhead  
**Complexity:** Moderate

#### Instead of:
```python
for recipient in recipients:
    send_message(recipient, allocation)
```

#### Do:
```python
batch = []
for recipient in recipients:
    batch.append({'recipient': recipient, 'amount': allocation})

send_batch(batch)  # Single network operation
```

#### Why It Works
- Reduces per-message overhead (headers, handshakes)
- Better TCP/IP utilization
- Can compress batch for additional savings

---

## Tier 3: Nice-to-Have Optimizations

### 7. Adaptive Epsilon (Relaxed Convergence)

**Impact:** 30-50% fewer rounds  
**Complexity:** Trivial

#### Formula
```
Epsilon-Strategy:

    If network-size < 100:
        ε = 0.01  # Tight convergence (1%)
    
    Else if network-size < 1000:
        ε = 0.03  # Moderate (3%)
    
    Else:
        ε = 0.05  # Looser for large networks (5%)

Or adaptive by round:
    
    If round < 3:
        ε = 0.10  # Loose early on
    Else:
        ε = 0.01  # Tight later
```

#### Why It Works
- Perfect convergence (ε=0.01) rarely needed in practice
- 5% error often imperceptible to users
- Significantly fewer rounds with marginal quality loss

## Convergence Speed Analysis

### Factors Affecting Convergence

```
Convergence-Speed ∝ 1 / Network-Density

Network-Density = (# of mutual-desire edges) / (# possible edges)

Expected-Rounds ≈ 3 + 2 × sqrt(Avg-Providers-Per-Recipient)
```

### Examples

**Low contention (2 providers/recipient average):**
- Without optimizations: ~10 rounds
- With Tier 1: ~4 rounds
- With adaptive epsilon: ~3 rounds

**Medium contention (4 providers/recipient):**
- Without optimizations: ~15 rounds
- With Tier 1: ~6 rounds
- With adaptive epsilon: ~4 rounds

**High contention (9 providers/recipient):**
- Without optimizations: ~25 rounds
- With Tier 1: ~9 rounds
- With adaptive epsilon: ~6 rounds

## Scalability Analysis

### Computational Complexity

**Per Provider, Per Round:**
```
For each Capacity (C capacities):
    For each Recipient (M mutually-desiring):
        O(1) operations
        
Total per provider: O(C × M)

With vectorization: O(C) + overhead
```

**Per Recipient, Per Round:**
```
For each Need-Type (T types):
    Sum P incoming allocations: O(P)
    
Total per recipient: O(T × P)
```

### Concrete Example: 10,000 Actors

**Scenario:**
- 10,000 providers
- 10,000 recipients  
- Each provider has 5 capacities
- Network density 0.5% (50 connections per provider)
- 3 need types
- Converges in 6 rounds (with optimizations)

**Per Provider:**
```
5 capacities × 50 recipients × 10 ops = 2,500 ops/round
× 6 rounds = 15,000 ops total
```

**If Parallel (distributed):**
```
Wall time: ~50-200ms per round
Total: ~300ms-1.2s
```

**If Serial (single machine):**
```
10,000 providers × 15,000 ops = 150M ops
On 3GHz CPU: ~50-100ms (if pure computation)
With I/O: ~1-5 seconds
```

### Practical Limits

| Scale | Actors | Convergence Time | Bottleneck |
|-------|--------|------------------|------------|
| Small | < 100 | < 1 second | None |
| Medium | 100-10K | 1-10 seconds | Computation |
| Large | 10K-1M | 10-60 seconds | Network I/O |
| Massive | > 1M | 60+ seconds | State sync |

---

## Advanced Optimization Strategies (Future)

### Hierarchical Convergence
```
Divide network into regions:
- Intra-region: Fast local convergence (3-5 rounds)
- Inter-region: Slower global adjustment (2-3 rounds)

Total: 5-8 rounds regardless of network size
```

**Complexity:** High  
**Benefit:** O(log N) scaling instead of O(N)

### Speculative Execution
```
Start Round N+1 calculations before Round N completes
If Round N results invalidate Round N+1:
    Rollback and retry

Happy case: 50% latency reduction
Worst case: Wasted computation
```

**Complexity:** High  
**Benefit:** Lower latency when state changes are small
