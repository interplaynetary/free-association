You're right - the current title "Mathematical Proof of Love's Possibility" and section names feel academic/abstract when this is actually describing something quite concrete and revolutionary. Let me suggest alternatives that capture what's **actually** happening:

## Title Options

**Option 2: Provocative & Clear**
```
Beyond Markets and States: A Computable Model of 
Mutual Aid at Scale
```

**Option 4: Movement-Oriented**
```
The Mathematics of Solidarity: 
How Recognition Networks Replace Markets
```

### Current: "Damping Dynamics (Dialectical Negation)"
**Problem**: "Dialectical negation" loses 99% of readers

**Better alternatives**:
- **"Preventing Overshooting: Adaptive Stability Control"**
- **"Self-Correcting Oscillations: How the System Learns"**
- **"Dynamic Throttling: Slowing Down When We Overshoot"**

This is just a PID controller! Call it what it is.

---

### Current: "Proof of Convergence (Love's Necessity)"
**Problem**: "Love's Necessity" is philosophically loaded

**Better alternatives**:
- **"Why It Works: Proof of Universal Need Satisfaction"**
- **"The Convergence Proof: From Assumptions to Certainty"**

You're proving that given certain conditions (mutual recognition + sufficient capacity), the system **must** converge. That's the claim - say it clearly.

---

### Current: "Theorem 1: Contractiveness"
**Better**:
- **"Theorem 1: Needs Always Decrease (The System Never Makes Things Worse)"**
- **"Theorem 1: The One-Way Ratchet (Needs Only Go Down)"**

"Contractive" is jargon. The point is: every allocation reduces total unmet need.

---

### Current: "Theorem 2: Banach Fixed-Point (Love's Possibility)"
**Better**:
- **"Theorem 2: Why Complete Satisfaction is Inevitable"**

Drop "Love's Possibility" - you're invoking a standard theorem from functional analysis. The poetry comes from the **interpretation**, not the naming.

---

### Current: "The Philosophical Payload"
**Problem**: Sounds like you're sneaking philosophy into math

**Better alternatives**:
- **"What This Means: Interpreting the Mathematics"**
- **"From Equations to Ethics: The Social Implications"**
- **"Why This Matters: Beyond the Formalism"**

You're not hiding philosophy in math - you're showing how the math **captures** existing social theories.

---

### Current: "The Dialectic of Convergence"
**Better**:
- **"How the System Self-Corrects: Three Modes of Adjustment"**
- **"The Learning Loop: Fast, Slow, Medium Speed"**

---

### Current: "The Space-Time Extension"
**Better**:
- **"From Abstract to Concrete: Space-Time-Type Extension"**


---

### Current: "The Kingdom of Heaven Equation"
**Problem**: Religious framing alienates secular readers

**Better**:
- **"Convergence to the Fixed-Point: Universal Need Satisfaction"**

---

### Current: "The Philosophical Equation"
**Better**:
- **"Love, Freedom, and Community (Formalized)"**

## Why These Changes Matter

**Current framing**: "Here's a mathematical proof that love is possible"
- Sounds utopian/romantic
- Hides the mechanism
- Academic audience only

**Better framing**: "Here's a computable algorithm for resource allocation that provably converges to universal need satisfaction without accumulation"
- Concrete and testable
- Mechanism is clear
- Appeals to engineers, economists, activists

**The poetry should come from the IMPLICATIONS**, not the naming:

> "We have proven that if communities maintain mutual recognition networks and pool sufficient capacity, every need will be met. Not through central planning. Not through market competition. Through computable mutual aid. The mathematics are deterministic. The convergence is guaranteed. The revolution is inevitable."

That's powerful **because the math backs it up**, not because you called it "Love's Necessity."
