# MRD Fix: Renormalized Recognition Distribution

## Problem Identified

The original implementation used **raw MR values** directly in allocation formulas. This meant:

```
Provider P recognizes:
  R1: 40% (mutual)
  R2: 25% (mutual)
  R3: 20% (non-mutual)
  R4: 15% (non-mutual)

Original approach:
  Tier 1 used MR(P,R1) = 0.40, MR(P,R2) = 0.25
  These are 40% and 25% of ALL recognition (including non-mutual)
  ‚ùå Not a clean 100% distribution within the mutual tier
```

## Solution Implemented

Each tier now uses **renormalized shares** that sum to 100% within that tier:

### Tier 1: Mutual Recognition Distribution (MRD)

```typescript
// Step 1: Compute total mutual recognition
totalMutualRecognition = Œ£ MR(P, R) for all R where MR > 0
                       = 0.40 + 0.25 = 0.65

// Step 2: Renormalize to 100% of mutual recognition
MRD(P, R1) = MR(P, R1) / totalMutualRecognition
           = 0.40 / 0.65
           = 0.615  (61.5% of MUTUAL recognition)

MRD(P, R2) = 0.25 / 0.65
           = 0.385  (38.5% of MUTUAL recognition)

Check: 0.615 + 0.385 = 1.0 = 100% ‚úì
```

### Tier 2: Renormalized Non-Mutual

```typescript
// Step 1: Compute total non-mutual recognition
totalNonMutualRecognition = Œ£ Weight(P‚ÜíR) where MR = 0
                          = 0.20 + 0.15 = 0.35

// Step 2: Renormalize to 100% of non-mutual recognition
Renormalized(P, R3) = Weight(P‚ÜíR3) / totalNonMutualRecognition
                    = 0.20 / 0.35
                    = 0.571  (57.1% of NON-MUTUAL recognition)

Renormalized(P, R4) = 0.15 / 0.35
                    = 0.429  (42.9% of NON-MUTUAL recognition)

Check: 0.571 + 0.429 = 1.0 = 100% ‚úì
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Semantic Clarity
- **Tier 1**: "I'm distributing 100% of my mutual recognition among R1 and R2"
- **Tier 2**: "I'm distributing 100% of my non-mutual recognition among R3 and R4"
- Each tier is a clean, independent distribution

### 2. Mathematical Elegance
```
Before: Using fractions of total recognition across tiers
After:  Each tier is a complete (100%) distribution within itself
```

### 3. Proportionality Preserved
```
The final allocations are unchanged!
The renormalization cancels out in the denominator formula:

Old: Allocation ‚àù MR √ó Need / Œ£(MR √ó Need)
New: Allocation ‚àù (MR/Total) √ó Need / Œ£((MR/Total) √ó Need)
     = MR √ó Need / (Total √ó Œ£(MR √ó Need / Total))
     = MR √ó Need / Œ£(MR √ó Need)  ‚Üê Same as old!

But the NEW way is semantically cleaner and more intuitive.
```

## Example Comparison

### Before (Raw MR):
```
Numerator(R1) = 0.40 √ó 500 = 200
Numerator(R2) = 0.25 √ó 400 = 100
Denominator = 300
Allocation(R1) = 1000 √ó 200/300 = 666.67
Allocation(R2) = 1000 √ó 100/300 = 333.33
```

### After (MRD):
```
MRD(R1) = 0.40/0.65 = 0.615
MRD(R2) = 0.25/0.65 = 0.385
Numerator(R1) = 0.615 √ó 500 = 307.5
Numerator(R2) = 0.385 √ó 400 = 154.0
Denominator = 461.5
Allocation(R1) = 1000 √ó 307.5/461.5 = 666.45
Allocation(R2) = 1000 √ó 154.0/461.5 = 333.55
```

**Result:** Same allocations (minor rounding), but cleaner semantics!

## Verification

```typescript
// Each tier is now a proper probability distribution:

// Tier 1 (Mutual):
Œ£ MRD(P, R) = 1.0 = 100% ‚úì

// Tier 2 (Non-Mutual):  
Œ£ Renormalized(P, R) = 1.0 = 100% ‚úì

// Conservation:
Total allocated = Tier1 + Tier2 ‚â§ Capacity ‚úì
```

## Self-Recognition Support

**Important clarification:** Self-recognition is fully supported and treated identically to recognizing others!

```typescript
// If you include yourself in your recognition weights:
myWeights[myPubKey] = 0.30  // 30% self-recognition

// Then:
MR(Me, Me) = min(myWeights[myPub], myWeights[myPub]) 
           = myWeights[myPub]
           = 0.30  ‚Üê Valid mutual self-recognition!
```

### Benefits of Self-Recognition:
- **Self-investment**: You can allocate capacity to yourself
- **Self-care**: Prioritize your own needs proportionally
- **Self-sufficiency**: Be both provider and recipient
- **No special cases**: Treated exactly like any other MR relationship

### Example:
```
Alice recognizes:
  Herself: 30%
  Bob: 40%
  Carol: 30%

MRD(Alice‚ÜíAlice) = 0.30/0.90 = 33.3% of mutual recognition
Alice can allocate 33.3% of her capacity to herself!
```

## Summary

The fix transforms raw recognition values into **proper probability distributions** within each tier:
- **Before**: Distributing fractions of total recognition
- **After**: Distributing 100% of tier-specific recognition

This makes the system more intuitive and mathematically elegant, while preserving the exact same allocation behavior!

**Plus:** Self-recognition is fully supported - you can recognize, allocate to, and receive from yourself! üéØ
