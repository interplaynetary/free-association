# Declarative Reactive Computation: Transparent Economic Infrastructure

We have created a computational infrastructure that fundamentally changes how economic coordination can work in decentralized communities. At its heart is something called "declarative reactive computation" - a system where instead of writing step-by-step instructions for computers, you simply declare relationships between different pieces of data, and the system automatically keeps everything synchronized. Think of it like a spreadsheet that can span across thousands of computers: when one person updates their availability or needs, everyone else's allocations instantly recalculate and update. This isn't just faster computing - it's a new way of organizing economic activity that makes coordination transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy without requiring central authorities or intermediaries. The system knows not just what the current state is, but exactly how it got there, who contributed what data, and whether the calculations can be trusted.

The provenance tracking system we've built addresses a fundamental trust problem in decentralized economies. When resources are being allocated based on community recognition and mutual aid, people need to know that the calculations are legitimate - that no one is gaming the system, that the allocations actually follow the agreed-upon rules, and that historical records can't be tampered with. Our system creates an immutable trail showing exactly where every piece of data came from, which calculations were performed, and who performed them. It's analogous to how blockchains provide transparency for financial transactions, but instead of just tracking money movement, we're tracking the entire computational process that decides how resources get allocated. This means participants can verify that allocations are fair without having to trust any single person or organization, and disputes can be resolved by examining the computational record rather than relying on authority figures.

The efficiency gains from our event-driven architecture create qualitatively new economic possibilities. Traditional coordination systems - whether markets or bureaucracies - require either continuous polling ("has anything changed?") or scheduled updates ("we'll recalculate everything at midnight"). Both approaches waste enormous resources: polling consumes computational power checking for changes that haven't happened, while scheduled updates create delays where people operate on stale information. Our system instead reacts instantly to actual changes - when someone's situation changes, only the affected calculations run, and only the people impacted get updated. This means a community of 10,000 people can coordinate in real-time with the computational cost of a small website, rather than requiring the infrastructure of a major corporation. The difference isn't just cost savings - it enables forms of economic organization that were previously impossible because the coordination overhead would have been prohibitive.

This computational infrastructure makes transparent, peer-to-peer economic coordination practical at internet scale. Consider how traditional markets handle price discovery: millions of individual transactions gradually reveal what something is "worth," but the process is opaque, manipulable, and often unfair to those with less market power. Or consider how bureaucracies allocate resources: through complex procedures that obscure decision-making and create opportunities for favoritism or corruption. Our system instead makes every step of resource allocation visible and verifiable. When a community decides to share childcare, housing, or professional services, every participant can see exactly how the system calculated their allocation, trace the data back to its source, and verify that the agreed-upon recognition principles were actually followed. This transparency doesn't just prevent abuse - it enables communities to experiment with different allocation principles and immediately see the results, fostering economic democracy in a way that neither markets nor states can match.

The real-world implications extend to how we can organize economic life at scale. The computational infrastructure we've built makes it feasible for communities to run sophisticated mutual aid networks, time banks, and resource-sharing systems without the overhead costs that typically kill such initiatives. A neighborhood tool library can track who's borrowing what, who's maintaining tools, and who should get priority access based on their contributions - all automatically, transparently, and fairly. A city-wide childcare cooperative can match families' schedules and needs in real-time without requiring paid administrators. A professional network can allocate mentorship and collaboration opportunities based on mutual recognition rather than money or credentials. These aren't utopian visions - they're practical economic activities that become viable when the computational cost of coordination drops from "requires a startup's infrastructure" to "runs on a laptop." The system doesn't eliminate the need for human judgment and social relationships, but it removes the computational barriers that have historically forced communities to choose between intimate small-scale cooperation and efficient large-scale markets. We've built infrastructure that makes peer-to-peer economic coordination as computationally efficient as centralized control, while maintaining the transparency and fairness that make commons sustainable.

## The Compute Infrastructure: Schema-Driven Coordination

At the technical heart of this system is what we call the "compute folder" - a collection of specialized tools that enable communities to define, execute, and verify economic coordination rules without programming expertise. The core innovation is schema-driven computation: instead of hiring programmers to write custom code for each community's allocation rules, communities can declare their coordination logic using simple, standardized schemas - essentially forms that describe where data comes from, what calculations to perform, and where results should go. Think of it like Mad Libs for economic coordination: there are blank spaces for "who should get priority," "how should we weight contributions," and "what resources are being shared," and communities fill in those blanks according to their values. The system then automatically turns those declarations into working, verifiable computation that can run across thousands of participants without anyone needing to understand the underlying code.

This schema-driven approach solves a critical barrier to commons-based organization: the expertise gap. Historically, any group wanting to run a sophisticated resource-sharing system needed either significant technical expertise within the group or enough money to hire developers and maintain custom software. Both requirements effectively limited commons to either highly technical communities or well-funded organizations, excluding the vast majority of groups who could benefit from shared resource coordination. Our compute infrastructure eliminates this barrier by making the computational tools generic and reusable. A tenant union, a neighborhood mutual aid network, and a professional co-op can all use the same underlying infrastructure - they just configure it differently by filling in different schemas. The system handles all the complex parts (synchronization across participants, conflict resolution, provenance tracking, data validation) automatically, while letting communities focus on the substantive questions: what are our values, how should we recognize contributions, what allocation principles do we want to follow?

The provenance system built into this infrastructure creates unprecedented accountability for economic decision-making. Every computation that happens - every allocation calculated, every recognition weight applied, every resource matched - generates a provenance record that shows exactly what data was used, where it came from, what calculation was performed, and who performed it. These records are cryptographically signed and linked together in a chain that makes tampering virtually impossible to hide. This means that if someone questions an allocation ("why did I receive this amount?" or "why was this person prioritized?"), the system can produce a complete, verifiable trail showing exactly how that decision was reached, traceable back to the original input data and the agreed-upon rules. This level of transparency is simply impossible in traditional systems - neither markets nor bureaucracies can show you the complete causal chain leading to a specific outcome. For communities, this means accountability without surveillance: the system records decisions, not personal information, and anyone can verify fairness without requiring centralized oversight.

The efficiency of this infrastructure comes from its event-driven reactive architecture, which ensures that computational work only happens when it's needed. Traditional systems recalculate everything periodically (like a spreadsheet where you manually click "refresh") or continuously poll for changes (constantly asking "did anything change yet?"). Both approaches waste resources. Our system instead sets up intelligent subscriptions: when data that affects a calculation changes, the system automatically triggers only the calculations that depend on that data, updating only the people who are impacted. This means that in a network of 10,000 people, if one person updates their availability, maybe only 50 calculations run (for the people who might be matched with that availability), rather than recomputing everything for everyone. The system scales elegantly because computational cost is proportional to actual activity, not to network size. A mostly-stable community of 10,000 people uses barely more computational resources than a community of 100 - the difference is only in the occasional updates, not in maintaining the network.

What makes this infrastructure particularly powerful is its composability - the ability to combine simple building blocks into sophisticated coordination systems. Communities can define small, reusable computation modules ("calculate mutual recognition between two people," "match availability with needs," "filter allocations based on location") and then compose them together into complete coordination workflows. This is analogous to how Lego blocks work: you don't need to manufacture a custom piece for every project; you combine standard pieces in different configurations. A childcare co-op might combine "match schedules" + "calculate mutual recognition" + "apply priority for long-term members," while a tool library might combine "track maintenance contributions" + "calculate recognition" + "match tool requests with availability." The computational infrastructure handles the complexity of making these modules work together, ensuring data flows correctly, calculations happen in the right order, and results are properly stored and shared. This composability means communities can start simple and gradually add sophistication as their needs evolve, without requiring technical overhauls or migrations to new systems.
