Ok amazing! Its working! Now the only thing is that when we initially load the page only 1 contributor pill shows up for any given node, but once we zoom in and out from that node, we see immediatelly ALL of the contributor pills! Why is that? Anaylze in depth

Make growth and shrinking visual while it is happening

improve the proportionality of buttons, and make it div based the area underneath the title is area for tags etc. and this is where contributors can be added, scale the button and tags to fit this space.

Ok great! Now for some reason though, when trying to create a node with no children, there is a % of the treemap container thatr can not be filled by nodes, our nodes dont occupz 100% of the space, there is empty space occupying space.

Lets make it so that clicking inventory, swaps the node-container

lets make it so that clicking the text in a node allows you to immediately edit it on the spot.
Substituting the text until you hit enter
but lets ensure that this looks good for mobile as well (in which case the pop up enter-name makes sense)

Contributions can't have children and you cant zoom in on them
