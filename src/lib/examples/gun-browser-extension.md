ok instead of immediaterly trying to code it, craft a master prompt outlining what we would need out of this browser extension, the goal is to either create a browser-extension that the user logs into, to subscribe in the background to certain paths, and notify the user using push.js or something similar. 

If we did this, we would not necessarily have to make it periodically open up the PWA and have a service-worker based approach, we would just allow the user to log into the browser extension and provide a json of the paths they wish to subscribe to within the gun/user path
