To analyze why "Unable to load tree data. Please try again." is appearing, I need to examine how tree data is loaded in the application.

Let's look at the available files:

Search files...
Let me search for more information about how the tree data is loaded:

Read file: src/routes/[nodeId]/+page.svelte
Let's check how the userTree store is populated:

Let's check if there's any code that initializes the tree data:

Let's check if there's a layout file that might initialize the tree:

Read file: src/routes/+layout.svelte
Let's check the layout.server.ts:

Read file: src/routes/+layout.server.ts
Let's check for code that loads the user tree on the client side:

Let's look at +app.js or +page.js in the routes directory:

Read file: src/routes/+page.svelte
Let's search for a potential client component that might be loading the data:

Let's check if there's a specific +page.ts client file for the [nodeId] route:

Now let's look for dependencies beyond the single current page that might be initializing the app:

Let's check if there's a global.svelte.ts file that might be referenced by the components:

Let's search for Header.svelte since it's imported in the layout and may be initializing the tree:

Read file: src/lib/components/Header.svelte
Let's check the rest of Header.svelte:

Let's see if there's a file with a component that might initialize the tree by fetching it:

Let's look for a hook or layout that might make the request:

Let's check if there are any client.js or page.client.js:

Let's try a more general search:

Based on my analysis, here's why you're seeing "Unable to load tree data. Please try again":

The error occurs because the `userTree` store is never populated after a user navigates to the `[nodeId]` route. Looking at the code, I can identify several key issues:

1. **Missing Tree Loading Logic**: There's an API endpoint at `/api/tree/[treeId]` that can retrieve a user's tree data, but no component is actually calling this endpoint when a user navigates to a node page.

2. **Navigation vs. Data Loading**: In `[nodeId]/+page.svelte`, the code sets the `currentPath` to the node ID from the URL, but it never fetches the tree data itself. It only updates the path and then immediately sets `isLoading` to false.

3. **Component Dependency**: The application architecture expects the `userTree` store to be populated before rendering components, but there's no mechanism in place to ensure this happens.

4. **Error Flow**: When `[nodeId]/+page.svelte` renders, it checks if `get(userTree)` has a value. Since no component has populated the store, this check fails and the error message is displayed.

5. **Authentication State**: The header component has authentication logic, but after a successful authentication, the application doesn't automatically load the user's tree data.

The primary missing piece is a function that should:

1. Make a fetch request to `/api/tree/{nodeId}`
2. Upon successful response, call `userTree.set(responseData.data)`

This function should be called when:

- A user successfully authenticates
- A user navigates to a specific node page

To fix this issue, you would need to add tree data loading logic where it's currently missing.

The issue is that navigation is updating the path variables in the app but the tree data isn't being loaded from the server. Looking at the console logs showing navigation works, but the UI shows "Unable to load tree data," this indicates a disconnection between path navigation and actual data fetching.

After analyzing the codebase, here's why:

1. **Missing Data Fetch Logic**: When navigation happens through `globalState.zoomInto()` in Parent.svelte (line 194), it successfully updates `currentPath` but no corresponding API call is made to fetch the tree data.

2. **Path-Only Navigation**: The navigation functions in simpleglobal.svelte only modify the `currentPath` store but don't trigger any data loading:

   ```javascript
   zoomInto: (nodeId: string) => {
     const path = get(currentPath);
     const tree = get(userTree);
     if (!tree) return; // This check prevents navigation if tree isn't loaded
     // [...] Updates path but doesn't load data
     currentPath.set([...path, nodeId]);
   }
   ```

3. **Missing Tree Initialization**: When the application loads a nodeId route, it sets the path correctly in setupNavigation() but never fetches the tree data from `/api/tree/{nodeId}`.

4. **Auth Completion Without Data Load**: After successful authentication in Header.svelte (around line 280), the code redirects to '/' but doesn't load any user tree data.

The navigation itself is working (path updates, console logs show this), but the application never populates the `userTree` store with actual data from the server, so the UI falls into the error case:

```svelte
{:else if get(userTree)}
  <Parent />
{:else}
  <div class="loading-container">
    <p>Unable to load tree data. Please try again.</p>
  </div>
{/if}
```

You need to implement a function that fetches tree data from the server and sets the userTree store, then call that function:

1. After successful login
2. On page navigation/initialization
3. When zoomInto/zoomOut is called

This fetch function should make a request to `/api/tree/{nodeId}` and then call `userTree.set(response.data)` with the result.
