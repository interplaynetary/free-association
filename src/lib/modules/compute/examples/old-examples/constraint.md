## Redesigning the Capacity Schema for Composite Economics

The current capacity schema, designed around individual resource ownership, fundamentally assumes a world where economic offerings are atomic - you either own something completely or you don't. But the composite capacity paradigm reveals this assumption as unnecessarily limiting. A redesigned schema must embrace the reality that modern economic value creation is inherently collaborative and compositional. The new schema should treat individual ownership as merely one special case of a more general pattern where capacities can be assembled from distributed components across trust networks.

At the architectural level, I would restructure the capacity schema around a **dual-nature design** where every capacity exists simultaneously as both a potential component (something others can include in their compositions) and a potential composite (something that might depend on other capacities). This eliminates the artificial distinction between "simple" and "composite" capacities that I initially created. Instead, every capacity would have optional `compositionSlots` and every capacity would expose `shareabilityConstraints` that define how it can be incorporated into other compositions. This unified approach simplifies the mental model while enabling recursive composition - composite capacities can seamlessly become components in higher-order compositions.

The resolution system requires a sophisticated **dependency graph architecture** that can handle both static and dynamic constraints. Unlike traditional databases where relationships are fixed, capacity dependencies shift constantly as mutual recognition values change. The schema must support **lazy evaluation** where composite capacities don't pre-calculate their availability but instead resolve it on-demand based on current network state. This means embedding a powerful constraint solver directly into the capacity system, with each capacity effectively becoming a **constraint satisfaction problem** that the system continuously monitors and resolves.

Divisibility constraints become significantly more complex in a composite context and require **constraint propagation mechanisms**. When Alice sets `max_percentage_div: 0.8` on her pie capacity, this constraint must automatically propagate through all composite capacities that depend on her pie, potentially affecting the feasibility of dozens of downstream offerings. The schema needs to track these constraint chains and provide efficient invalidation cascades when constraints change. This suggests a **reactive architecture** where constraint changes trigger focused recomputation only of affected composite capacities, rather than global recalculation.

The temporal dimension adds another layer of complexity that the current schema barely addresses. Composite capacities exist in time - they require coordination across multiple people's schedules and availability windows. The redesigned schema must handle **temporal composition**, where a potluck capacity isn't just about having enough food components, but about having them available at the same time. This requires extending the space-time coordinate system to support **temporal constraint satisfaction** across multiple interdependent capacities, potentially with sophisticated conflict resolution when scheduling constraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

Storage and serialization present interesting challenges for composite capacities. The current JSON-serializable approach works well for simple capacities, but composite capacities create **circular reference problems** and **massive denormalization issues** if naively implemented. The redesigned schema should embrace a **graph database architecture** where capacities are stored as nodes with typed edges representing different kinds of dependencies (composition, mutual recognition, temporal coordination). This enables efficient querying of complex dependency patterns while maintaining referential integrity across the network.

The user experience implications drive significant schema design decisions. Users shouldn't need to understand the underlying complexity of constraint satisfaction and dependency resolution. The schema should support **progressive disclosure** where simple capacities appear simple, but complex compositions are possible for power users. This suggests a **layered schema design** where the core capacity structure remains familiar, but advanced features like complex aggregation rules, fallback chains, and conditional dependencies are optional extensions that don't clutter the basic interface.

Network effects become crucial when capacities can reference other capacities across the network. The schema must support **capacity discovery mechanisms** where people can find relevant capacities to include in their compositions. This requires rich metadata, tagging systems, and compatibility indicators that help users understand which capacities can meaningfully compose together. The schema should also support **composition templates** that capture common patterns (like potluck dinners) and make them easily reusable across different contexts and social networks.

Performance optimization requires careful attention to **caching and invalidation strategies**. When mutual recognition values change, potentially hundreds of composite capacities might need recomputation. The schema should support **incremental updates** and **memoization** of expensive constraint resolution operations. This suggests embedding version timestamps and dependency fingerprints directly into the capacity schema, enabling intelligent cache invalidation that minimizes unnecessary recomputation while ensuring consistency across the distributed system.

Looking toward future extensibility, the schema should embrace **plugin architectures** for new types of composition logic, aggregation rules, and constraint types. Rather than hardcoding specific patterns like "sum" or "min" aggregation, the schema should support **pluggable composition functions** that can be extended as new economic coordination patterns emerge. This future-proofs the system and enables experimentation with novel forms of collaborative value creation that we haven't yet imagined. The capacity schema becomes not just a data structure, but a **coordination language** for expressing complex economic relationships in an increasingly networked world.

Our system is distributed, as you can see each player subscribes to their shares in the capacities of others in network.svelte, and then we locally recreate the computed quantities for our share in those capacities. 

all we need is to be able to compose our own shares into our capacities, with the computed quantities from userNetworkCapacitiesWithShares

## Constraint Solving in Composite Capacity Systems

The constraint solving aspect of composite capacities represents one of the most technically sophisticated challenges in the system, requiring real-time resolution of complex interdependent constraints across distributed networks. Unlike traditional constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) that operate on static domains, composite capacity constraints are **dynamic, probabilistic, and socially mediated**. The constraint solver must simultaneously handle mathematical optimization (maximizing available quantities), logical satisfaction (meeting minimum requirements), temporal coordination (scheduling alignment), and social dynamics (mutual recognition fluctuations). This creates a unique class of constraint problem that I call **Social Constraint Satisfaction Problems (SCSPs)**, where the constraint domains themselves shift based on human relationship dynamics.

The **constraint hierarchy** in composite capacities operates across multiple interdependent layers, each with different solving strategies. At the base layer are **individual capacity constraints** like divisibility rules and ownership limits - these are deterministic and locally solvable. The middle layer contains **composition constraints** that define how multiple capacities can combine, including required quantities, aggregation rules, and compatibility requirements. The top layer involves **network constraints** that emerge from the distributed nature of the system - mutual recognition values, provider availability, and temporal coordination across multiple parties. The constraint solver must work bottom-up through this hierarchy, but changes at any layer can invalidate solutions at higher layers, requiring sophisticated **constraint propagation** and **backtracking mechanisms**.

**Temporal constraint solving** adds significant complexity because composite capacities exist in four-dimensional space-time, requiring coordination across multiple people's schedules and resource availability windows. Consider a workshop capacity that requires Alice's studio space (Tuesdays 2-6pm), Bob's tools (weekdays only), and Carol's expertise (available sporadically). The constraint solver must find temporal intersections while respecting each person's individual constraints and the mutual recognition percentages that determine access levels. This becomes a **multi-dimensional scheduling problem** where the solution space shrinks dramatically as more components are added. The solver needs efficient algorithms for **temporal intersection discovery** and **conflict resolution strategies** when perfect alignment isn't possible.

The **dynamic nature of social constraints** creates unique challenges not found in traditional constraint systems. Mutual recognition values can shift continuously as people interact, collaborate, or have conflicts, causing the entire constraint landscape to reshape in real-time. A composite capacity that was feasible yesterday might become impossible today if a key relationship deteriorates, or suddenly become much more abundant if collaborations strengthen. The constraint solver must handle these **non-monotonic updates** efficiently, ideally with **incremental solving** that doesn't require complete re-computation when only a subset of relationships change. This suggests using **dependency tracking** and **change propagation algorithms** that can isolate affected constraint regions and solve only the minimal necessary subproblems.

**Over-constrained systems** are inevitable when dealing with complex compositions across multiple providers with their own limitations. When Charlie's potluck requires 8 pie slices but he only has access to 3, the traditional constraint satisfaction approach would simply fail. But social systems require more nuanced responses - perhaps the constraint solver can suggest **relaxation strategies** (reduce potluck size to 6 people), **substitution alternatives** (use cake instead of pie), or **negotiation opportunities** (increase collaboration with Alice to gain more pie access). The solver should generate **solution spaces** rather than binary success/failure, showing users the trade-offs and possibilities available within current constraints.

**Recursive constraint propagation** becomes essential when composite capacities depend on other composite capacities, creating potentially deep dependency chains. Consider a music festival capacity that depends on multiple concert capacities, each of which depends on venue, equipment, and performer capacities distributed across the network. Changes in mutual recognition between any two people in this network could ripple through multiple layers of composition, affecting the feasibility of the entire festival. The constraint solver needs **efficient graph traversal algorithms** and **cycle detection** to prevent infinite recursion, while also implementing **memoization strategies** to avoid redundant computation of frequently accessed constraint subproblems.

**Real-time constraint solving** versus **batch processing** represents a crucial architectural decision with significant user experience implications. Users expect immediate feedback when exploring potential compositions - they want to know instantly whether their proposed potluck is feasible given current network relationships. This requires **incremental constraint solving** with sub-second response times, which challenges traditional constraint satisfaction algorithms designed for offline optimization. The system might need **approximation algorithms** that can quickly provide "probably feasible" answers while more expensive exact solving happens in the background, updating the UI when precise results are available.

**Constraint conflict resolution** requires sophisticated mediation mechanisms when multiple composite capacities compete for the same underlying resources. If both Charlie's potluck and David's dinner party want Alice's pie capacity on the same evening, the constraint solver needs fair allocation strategies. This might involve **auction mechanisms** where mutual recognition values determine priority, **time-sharing algorithms** that automatically suggest alternative scheduling, or **collaborative optimization** that proposes merged events when beneficial. The solver should also implement **fairness constraints** that prevent any single person from monopolizing network resources, even if they have high mutual recognition scores.

**Performance optimization** becomes critical as the network grows and constraint problems become exponentially more complex. The solver should implement **constraint pruning** techniques that eliminate obviously infeasible combinations early, **hierarchical decomposition** that breaks large problems into manageable subproblems, and **parallel solving** for independent constraint regions. The system might also benefit from **machine learning approaches** that learn from historical constraint solving patterns to guide search strategies more efficiently. **Constraint caching** with intelligent invalidation ensures that repeated similar problems don't require complete re-solving.

The **user interface implications** of constraint solving require careful design to make complex constraint satisfaction accessible without overwhelming users with mathematical complexity. The system should provide **constraint visualization** that shows users why certain compositions aren't feasible and what changes would make them possible. **Interactive constraint exploration** lets users adjust parameters (reduce required quantities, extend time windows, add fallback options) and see real-time updates to feasibility. **Constraint explanation** systems should be able to tell users "Your potluck needs 2 more pie slices - collaborate more with Alice or find an alternative pie provider" rather than just reporting "constraint violation." This transforms constraint solving from an invisible technical process into a **collaborative negotiation tool** that helps people understand and navigate their network relationships more effectively.
