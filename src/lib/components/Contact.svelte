    // we want a simple contacts component
    // it should have a search bar
    // allow you to create new contacts: and associate them with an alias/pubkey
    // delete contacts
    // update contacts
    // should prevent you from having/creating multiple contacts for the same pubkey

    // each contact should have:
    // - a unique contact-id (to be used in the tree)
    // - a name (that you attribute): (by default it's the alias)
    // - alias
    // - public key
    // - avatar
    // - email, phone, website etc.

    // should display categories they show up in your tree

    // - a list of tags
    // - a list of capacities
    // - a list of compositions

    // this would allow you to recognize people in your interface who are not yet actually signed up to free-association
    // and once they sign up, you can associate the contact with their alias/pubkey!
