# **High Mutual Desire + Low Mutual Recognition = Algorithm Divergence**

## **The Critical Scenario: High Mutual Desire, Imbalanced MR**

### **Setup: Alice's 10 Pies**

- **MR Values**: Bob=0.1, Carol=0.9 (huge imbalance!)
- **Recipient Desires**: Bob=8, Carol=8 (both want a lot)
- **Provider Desires**: Bob=8, Carol=8 (Alice wants to give a lot to both)

### **Mutual Desires**

- Bob: min(8,8) = 8 pies (high mutual desire)
- Carol: min(8,8) = 8 pies (high mutual desire)
- Total mutual demand: 16 pies (but only 10 available!)

---

## **Approach 1: Mutual Fulfillment (MR-Driven)**

**Step 1: Normalize MR Among Mutual Interests**

- Bob: 0.1/(0.1+0.9) = 10%
- Carol: 0.9/1.0 = 90%

**Step 2: Raw MR Allocation**

- Bob: 10 × 10% = 1 pie
- Carol: 10 × 90% = 9 pies

**Step 3: Apply Mutual Desire Constraints**

- Bob: min(1, 8) = 1 pie
- Carol: min(9, 8) = 8 pies
- Used: 9 pies, Unused: 1 pie

**Step 4: Redistribute to Unsatisfied by MR Proportions**

- Bob: unsatisfied (wants 8, has 1)
- Carol: satisfied (wants 8, has 8)
- Bob gets the 1 unused pie → Bob = 2 pies
- **Final: Bob=2, Carol=8, Unused=0**

---

## **Approach 2: Provider Scaling + Redistribution (Provider-Driven)**

**Step 1: Provider Preference Ratios**

- Total provider desire: 8+8 = 16
- Bob: 8/16 = 50%
- Carol: 8/16 = 50%

**Step 2: Allocate by Provider Ratios**

- Bob: 10 × 50% = 5 pies
- Carol: 10 × 50% = 5 pies

**Step 3: Apply Mutual Desire Constraints**

- Bob: min(5, 8) = 5 pies
- Carol: min(5, 8) = 5 pies
- Used: 10 pies, Unused: 0 pies

**Step 4: Redistribute to Maximize Fulfillment**

- Bob: unsatisfied (wants 8, has 5)
- Carol: unsatisfied (wants 8, has 5)
- No unused capacity to redistribute
- **Final: Bob=5, Carol=5, Unused=0**

## **DIVERGENCE REVEALED!**

| Approach                              | Bob    | Carol  | Unused |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Mutual Fulfillment**                | 2 pies | 8 pies | 0 pies |
| **Provider Scaling + Redistribution** | 5 pies | 5 pies | 0 pies |

## **The Key Insight: Two Forms of Sovereignty**

**Mutual Fulfillment (MR-Based) says:**

- "Carol contributes 90% to Alice's priority realization, Bob contributes 10%"
- "Allocate capacity to maximize mutual priority realization"
- Carol gets more because she's more valuable to Alice's priorities

**Provider Scaling (Desire-Based) says:**

- "Alice wants to give equally regardless of priority contribution"
- "Allocate capacity based on provider's current desires"
- Equal distribution based on Alice's current intent, not priority optimization

## **When Do They Diverge?**

The algorithms diverge when:

1. **High mutual desires** (both parties want the transaction)
2. **Imbalanced MR** (priority contribution is not proportional to current desires)
3. **Scarcity** (not enough capacity to satisfy everyone)

## **The Fundamental Tension You've Identified**

This reveals two different approaches to sovereignty:

**Option A: Priority-Optimized Allocation (MR-Based)**

- Allocate to maximize mutual priority realization
- Carol gets more because she contributes more to Alice's priorities
- **Question**: "Who helps me achieve my priorities most?"

**Option B: Desire-Proportional Allocation (Provider-Based)**

- Allocate in proportion to how provider wants to give
- Equal distribution because Alice currently desires to give equally
- **Question**: "How do I want to distribute my capacity right now?"

## **The Core Tension**

**Priority Realization vs Current Desires:**

- **MR Approach**: Optimize for long-term mutual priority achievement
- **Provider Approach**: Honor immediate provider preferences

**Both are valid forms of sovereignty!**

- **MR Sovereignty**: "I want my allocations to optimize our mutual priorities"
- **Desire Sovereignty**: "I want to allocate exactly as I currently desire"

**Your insight: There's a tension between allocating to favor mutual-priority realization vs allocating purely based on current proportional desires.**
